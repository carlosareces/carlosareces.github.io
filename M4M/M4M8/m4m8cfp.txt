8th Worskhop on "Methods for Modalities" (M4M-8)
Lake Placid, New York, June 9, 2013

====================================================================

Scope
-----
The workshop ''Methods for Modalities'' (M4M) aims to bring together
researchers interested in developing algorithms, verification methods
and tools based on modal logics. Here the term ''modal logics'' is
conceived broadly, including temporal logic, description logic,
guarded fragments, conditional logic, temporal and hybrid logic, etc.

To stimulate interaction and transfer of expertise, M4M will feature a
number of invited talks by leading scientists, research presentations
aimed at highlighting new developments, and submissions of
system demonstrations.

We strongly encourage young researchers and students to submit papers 
and posters, especially for experimental and prototypical software tools
which are related to modal logics.

Paper Submissions
------------------

Authors are invited to submit papers in the following three categories. 
In all cases the LNCS style should be used.

- Regular papers up to 15 pages including bibliography, describing original 
  research.

- System descriptions of up to 12 pages including bibliography, describing 
  new systems or significant upgrades of existing ones.

- Presentation-only papers, describing work recently published or submitted 
  (no page limit). These will not be included in the proceedings, but pre-prints 
  or post-prints can be made available to participants.

Submissions should be made via EasyChair at the following address:

http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=m4m8

The final versions of the selected contributions will be collected in a volume 
to be distributed at the workshop. These informal proceedings will also be made 
accessible on the web. We plan to publish selected papers in ENTCS or in a special 
journal issue on the topic of the M4M workshop after an extra refereeing round.
