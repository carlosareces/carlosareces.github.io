Yde Venema: Proof systems for Moss' coalgebraic modality

After a quick introduction to coalgebra as a mathematical theory of
systems, we discuss the coalgebraic logic as presented by Moss in
the 90s. The language of this formalism is based on a non-standard
modality, which in the case coalgebras for the power set functor (ie
Kripke frames) is also known as the cover modality.

The main topic of the talk concerns some derivation systems that, with
various coauthors, I have been developing over the last couple of years.
First I will introduce a sound and complete Hilbert-style system, and
then I will move on to discuss some sound, complete, and cut-free Gentzen
system.

Time permitting I will also address some consequences of these results,
such as uniform interpolation and complexity results.
