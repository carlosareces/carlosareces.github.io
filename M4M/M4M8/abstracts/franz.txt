Franz Baader: Small is Again Beautiful in Description Logics

The Description Logic (DL) research of the last 20 years was mainly
concerned with increasing the expressive power of the employed
description language without losing the ability of implementing
highly-optimized reasoning systems that behave well in practice,
in spite of the ever increasing worst-case complexity of the underlying
inference problems.

OWL DL, the standard ontology language for the Semantic Web, is
based on such an expressive DL for which reasoning is highly
intractable. Its sublanguage OWL Lite was intended to provide a
tractable version of OWL, but turned out to be only of a slightly
lower worst-case complexity than OWL DL. This and other reasons
have led to the development of two new families of light-weight DLs,
EL and DL-Lite, which recently have been proposed as profiles of
OWL 2, the next version of the OWL standard. In this talk, we give
an introduction to these new families logics and explain the
rationales underlying their design.
