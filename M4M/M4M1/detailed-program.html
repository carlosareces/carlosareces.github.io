	    <DT><B>Thursday, May 6, 09:30-10:45</B><DD> David Basin, <I>Verification 
	    Based on Monadic Logic</I><BR><BR>
	    Logic offers the possibility of modeling and reasoning about hardware and 
	    software systems.  But which logic?  We propose monadic logics of strings 
	    and trees as good candidates for many kinds of discrete systems. These 
	    logics are natural, decidable, yet substantially more expressive, 
	    extensions of Boolean logic.  We motivate their applicability through 
	    examples and report on experience with a verification tool based on the 
	    WS2S (the weak second-order monadic theory of two successors) , which 
	    implements validity checking/counter-model generation based on a reduction 
	    of formulas to canonical automata.

	    Resolution for Testing Modal Satisfiability and Building Models</I><BR>
	    <BR>
	    There are a variety of automated reasoning approaches for modal logics. An 
	    approach which this talk will focus on is resolution via translation to 
	    first-order logic.  The approach offers much more than just another 
	    inference calculus.  Indeed, as I will illustrate, resolution provides a 
	    very general and powerful framework for developing practical inference 
	    methods for very expressive logics, and also for studying other issues such 
	    as decidability, the finite model property, the automatic generation of 
	    models, and the characterisation of models.  In this talk I will 
	    concentrate on extended modal logics, different translation methods, 
	    different refinement strategies for obtaining decision procedures, and ways 
	    of generating models.

	    <I>Internalizing Labelled Deduction</I><BR>
	    <BR>
	    In this talk I am going to discuss labelled deduction, but from a somewhat 
	    unusual perspective. Instead of viewing labelled deduction as the process 
	    of manipulating modal formulas with the help of a labelling algebra, I want 
	    to discuss what happens when the modal object language is enriched so that 
	    it contains labels as first class citizens. The resulting language is 
	    called the {\it basic hybrid language\/}, and as I shall show, it provides 
	    a setting for modal deduction in which labelling discipline emerges as 
	    logic.  For the most part this talk will be an example-driven introduction 
	    to the method, but I also want to indicate the relevance of other recent 
	    work on hybrid languages.

	    <DT><B>Friday, May 7, 09:00-10:15</B><DD> Ian Horrocks, <I>Tableaux 
	    Algorithms and Implementations</I><BR>
	    <BR>
	    Reasoning in propositional modal logics is inherently intractable: even for 
	    K, deciding the satisfiability of a single formula is in PSpace, while 
	    satisfiability with respect to a theory (a set of axioms) is already in 
	    ExpTime. In spite of this, implementations of tableaux algorithms, even for 
	    logics significantly more expressive than K, have proved effective in 
	    realistic applications. This has been achieved by a careful choice of 
	    logical language (avoiding, for example, the transitive closure operator), 
	    and the use of a range of optimisation techniques in the implementation. 
	    This talk will briefly introduce Description Logics (DLs) as notational 
	    variants of propositional modal logics, and discuss how studies of DLs and 
	    DL applications have both influenced the choice of language and suggested 
	    ideas for optimisation techniques. We will then see how the choice of 
	    logical language facilitates optimised implementation and study in more 
	    detail some optimisation techniques that have proved particularly 
	    effective.

	    <DT><B>Friday, May 7, 11:15-12:30</B><DD> Hans de Nivelle, <I>Resolution Implementations</I><BR>
	    <BR>
	    We explain the most important design decisions that were made during
the implementation of the theorem prover Bliksem.
Bliksem is a first order, resolution based theorem prover. One of
its design objectives was to efficiently implement resolution based
decision procedures.
First, we discuss the problem of how to internally represent terms,
and formulae. We present 5 different ways of representing terms.
Benchmarks indicate that the differences are significant.
The fastest is what we call the 'prefix with end' representation.
Second, we consider the problem of how to implement substitutions.
Here again the difference between good and bad implementation is
quite large.
The third problem that we consider is the question of how to implement
the simplification operations subsumption, demodulation, unit-resolution.
The question of how to implement them cannot be separated from
the theoretical question up to what level, and when, these simplifications
should be made.
This problem is particularly important for theorem proving in the
context of modal logics, since the termination behaviour may depend
on simplification.

	    <DT><B>Friday, May 7, 16:00-17:15</B><DD> Roberto Sebastiani, <I>Evaluating the Efficiency of Decision Procedures for Modal Logics</I><BR>
	    <BR>
Five years ago we started testing extensively the performances of modal 
theorem provers.
Since then, extensive empirical testing has been playing a key role in 
stimulating and
guiding the development of increasingly faster procedures.
In this talk I will try to summarize this five-year experience in empirical 
testing.
I will present a brief summary of the main testing methodologies, describing
the main ideas and goals; in particular, I'll focus on those methods based 
on randomly generated
formulas. I'll discuss some efficiency issues suggested by the empirical 
results,
and outline some lessons learned about empirical testing itself.
