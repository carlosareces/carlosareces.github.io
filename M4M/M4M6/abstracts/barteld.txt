Barteld Kooi: Logics for intelligent interaction 

One of the prominent themes in logic today is intelligent interaction,
which occurs in any social situation, from simple conversations to
complex procedures in institutionalized social structures. There are
modal logical theories focussing on concepts such as intention,
information, action and rationality. There is such a multitude that
for one and the same subject there is more than one approach. There is
a great need to establish whether alternative approaches actually
provide fundamentally different perspectives, or whether the
differences are merely superficial.  

In the talk several logics will be presented, their interrelations,
and methods for relating them will be discussed.
