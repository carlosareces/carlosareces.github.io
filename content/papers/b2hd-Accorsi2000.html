         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We report on ongoing work on using a constraint-based                 approach towards fature interaction detection.     
            Constraint programming is introduced as a natural way                 of handling the inherent non-monotonic aspects of  
            feature integration. Starting from a logic                 specification of the Basic Call Service (BCS), we             
            obtain a labeled transition system rerpresenting this                 service. This graphical interpretation is implemented
            in smodels and tested for a variety of properties. We                 have devised a stepwise methodology for integrating
            features. Acoording to our method, geatures act as                 constraints on models of the original basic system. On
                            the one hand they forbid some of the original behaviour                 of the system (thus pruning some models),
            and on the                 other hey give rise to new models, representing new                 behavior. Using this methodology,
            we have so far                 implemented a small number of features on top of the                 basic call service, and
            we report on some of the tests                 that we have performed.
