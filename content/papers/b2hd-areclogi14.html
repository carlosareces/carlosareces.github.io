         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We propose a logic with the dynamic modal operators copy and remove.	The copy operator replicates a given model, and the remove
            operator	removes paths in a given model. We show that the product update by	an action model (with Boolean pre-conditions)
            in dynamic epistemic	logic decomposes in copy and remove operations. We also show that	copy and remove operators (of path
            of length 1) can be expressed	by action models. We investigate the complexity of the satisfiability	problem of syntactic fragments
            of the logic with copy and remove	operations.
