         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">In this paper, we propose to reinterpret the problem                 of generating referring expressions (GRE) as the    
            problem of computing a formula in a description logic                 that is only satisfied by the referent. This view  
                          offers a new unifying perspective under which existing                 GRE algo- rithms can be compared. We
            also show that by                 applying existing algorithms for computing simulation                 classes in description
            logic, we can obtain extremely                 efficient algorithms for rela- tional referring                 expressions
            without any dan- ger of running into                 infinite regress.
