         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">In this paper we introduce a prioritized default                 logic. We build this logic modularly from Standard      
                      Deontic Logic by the addition of default rules and                 priorities among them. Our main aim is to provide
            a                 logical framework to reason about scenarios where                 prescriptive and descriptive statements
            coexist and may                 be incomplete and contradictory. We motivate and                 illustrate the technical
            elements of our work with the                 use of examples (classical, and coming from software                 engineering).
            In addition, we present sound, complete,                 and terminating (with loop check) tableau-based proof           
                 calculi for credulous and sceptical reasoning in our                 logic.
