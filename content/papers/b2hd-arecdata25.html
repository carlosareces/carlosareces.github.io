         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Labelled tableaux have been a traditional approach to define satisfiabilitychecking procedures for Modal Logics. In many cases,
            they can also be used to obtain tightcomplexity bounds and lead to efficient implementations of reasoning tools. More recently,it
            has been shown that the expressive power provided by the operators characterizingHybrid Logics (nominals and satisfiability
            modalities) can be used to internalize labels,leading to well-behaved inference procedures for fairly expressive logics. The
            resultingprocedures are attractive because they do not use external mechanisms outside the languageof the logic at hand, and
            have good logical and computational properties.Many tableau systems based on Hybrid Logic have been investigated, with more
            recentefforts concentrating on Modal Logics that support data comparison operators. Here, weintroduce an internalized tableau
            calculus for XPath, arguably one of the most prominentapproaches for querying semistructured data. More precisely, we define
            data-aware tableauxfor XPath featuring data comparison operators and enriched with nominals and thesatisfiability modalities
            from Hybrid Logic. We prove that the calculus is sound, completeand terminating. Moreover, we show that tableaux can be explored
            in polynomial space,therefore establishing that the satisfiability problem for the logic is PSpace-complete.Finally, we explore
            different extensions of the calculus, in particular how to handle datatrees and other frame classes.
