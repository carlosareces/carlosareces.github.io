         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We investigate model theoretic properties of XPath                 with data (in)equality tests over the class of data   
            trees, i.e., the class of trees where each node                 contains a label from a finite alphabet and a data       
            value from an infinite domain. We provide notions of                 (bi)simulations for XPath logics containing the child,
            descendant, parent and ancestor axes to navigate the                 tree. We show that these notions precisely characterize
            the equivalence relation associated with each logic. We                 study formula complexity measures consisting of the
            number of nested axes and nested subformulas in a                 formula; these notions are akin to the notion of       
            quantifier rank in first-order logic. We show                 characterization results for fine grained notions of       
            equivalence and (bi)simulation that take into account                 these complexity measures. We also prove that positive
            fragments of these logics correspond to the formulas                 preserved under (non-symmetric) simulations. We show
            that the logic including the child axis is equivalent                 to the fragment of first-order logic invariant under
            the corresponding notion of bisimulation. If upward                 navigation is allowed the characterization fails but a
                            weaker result can still be established. The results in                 this article hold both over the class
            of possibly                 infinite data trees and over the class of finite data                 trees. Besides their intrinsic
            theoretical value, we                 argue that bisimulations are useful tools to prove                 (non)expressivity
            results for the logics studied here,                 and we substantiate this claim with examples.
