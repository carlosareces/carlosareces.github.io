         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We investigate model theoretic properties of XPath with data (in)equality	tests over the class of data trees, i.e., the class
            of trees where	each node contains a label from a finite alphabet and a data value	from an infinite domain. We provide notions
            of (bi)simulations for	XPath logics containing the child, descendant, parent and ancestor	axes to navigate the tree. We show
            that these notions precisely characterize	the equivalence relation associated with each logic.	We study formula complexity
            measures consisting of the number of nested	axes and nested subformulas in a formula; these notions are akin	to the notion
            of quantifier rank in first-order logic. We show characterization	results for fine grained notions of equivalence and (bi)simulation	that
            take into account these complexity measures. We also prove that	positive fragments of these logics correspond to the formulas
            preserved	under (non-symmetric) simulations.	We show that the logic including the child axis is equivalent to the	fragment
            of first-order logic invariant under the corresponding notion	of bisimulation. If upward navigation is allowed the characterization	fails
            but a weaker result can still be established.	The results in this article hold both over the class of possibly infinite	data
            trees and over the class of finite data trees. Besides their	intrinsic theoretical value, we argue that bisimulations are
            useful	tools to prove (non)expressivity results for the logics studied here,	and we substantiate this claim with examples.
