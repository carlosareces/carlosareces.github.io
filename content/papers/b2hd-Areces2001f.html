         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Hybrid languages are expansions of propositional modal                 languages which can refer to (or even quantify over)
            worlds. The use of strong hybrid languages dates back                 to at least [Pri67], but recent work (for example  
            [BS98, BT98a, BT99]) has focussed on a more constrained                 system called H(\downarrow, @). We show in detail
            that                 H(\downarrow, @) is modally natural. We begin by                 studying its expressivity, and provide
            model theoretic                 characterizations (via a restricted notion of                 Ehrenfeucht- Fraisse game, and
            an enriched notion of                 bisimulation) and a syntactic characterization (in                 terms of bounded
            formulas). The key result to emerge is                 that H(\downarrow, @) corresponds to the fragment of              
            first-order logic which is invariant for generated                 submodels. We then show that H(\downarrow, @) enjoys  
                          (strong) interpolation, provide counterexamples for its                 finite variable fragments, and show
            that weak                 interpolation holds for the sublanguage H(@). Finally,                 we provide complexity results
            for H(@) and other                 fragments and variants, and sharpen known                 undecidability results for H(\downarrow,
            @).
