         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We introduce a logic for representing the deontic                 notion of knowingly complying &acirc;&#128;&#147;associated to an      
            agent&acirc;&#128;&#153;s conciousness of taking a normative course of                 action for achieving a certain goal. Our logic features
            an operator for describing normative courses of                 actions, and another operator for describing what each   
                         agent knowingly complies with. We provide a sound and                 complete axiom system for our logic, and
            study the                 computational complexity of its satisfiability problem.                 Finally, we extend our logic
            with an additional                 operator for capturing the general abilities of the                 agents. This operator
            enables us to distinguish &acirc;&#128;&#152;what                 agents can do&acirc;&#128;&#153; and &acirc;&#128;&#152;what agents do according to                 norms&acirc;&#128;&#153;.
            For this extension, we also provide a sound                 and complete axiom system.
