         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Taking as inspiration the hybrid logic HL(\downarrow),                 we introduce a new family of logics that we call memory
            logics. In this article we present in detail two                 interesting members of this family defining their       
                     formal syntax and semantics. We then introduce a proper                 notion of bisimula- tion and investigate
            their                 expressive power (in comparison with modal and hybrid                 logics). We will prove that in
            terms of expressive                 power, the memory logics we discuss in this paper are                 more expressive
            than ortho- dox modal logic, but less                 expressive than HL(\downarrow). We also establish the              
              undecidability of their satisfiability problems.
