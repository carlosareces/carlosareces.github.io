         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">In this paper we develop the theoretical foundations                 to exploit symmetries in modal logics. We generalize
            the notion of symmetries of propositional formulas in                 conjunctive normal form to modal formulas using the
            framework provided by coinductive modal models                 introduced in [1].Hence, the results apply to a wide      
                      class of modal logics including, for example, hybrid                 logics. We present two graph constructions
            that enable                 the reduction of symmetry detection in modal formulas                 to the graph automorphism
            detection problem, and we                 evaluate the graph constructions on modal benchmarks.
