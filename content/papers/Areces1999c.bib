  abstract =     "Hybrid languages are extended modal languages which
                 can refer to (or even quantify over) worlds. The use of
                 strong hybrid languages dates back to at least [Pri67],
                 but recent work (for example [BS98, BT99]) has focussed
                 on a more constrained system called H(\downarrow, @).
                 The purpose of the present paper is to show in detail
                 that H(\dowarrow, @) is a modally natural system. We
                 study its expressivity, and provide both model
                 theoretic characterizations (via a restricted notion of
                 Ehrenfeucht-Fraı̈ssé game, and an enriched notion of
                 bisimulation) and a syntactic characterization (in
                 terms of bounded formulas). The key result is that
                 H(\downarrow, @) corresponds precisely to the
                 first-order fragment which is invariant for generated
                 submodels.",
