         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Even though residuation is at the core of Categorial                 Grammar [11], it is not always immediate to realize how
            standard logic systems like Multi-modal Categorial Type                 Logics (MCTL) [17] actually embody this property.
            In                 this paper we focus on the basic system NL [12] and its                 extension with unary modalities
            NL(3) [16], and we                 spell things out by means of Display Calculi (DC) [3,                 10]. The use of structural
            operators in DC permits a                 sharp distinction between the core properties we want                 to impose
            on the logic system and the way these                 properties are projected into the logic operators. We              
            will show how we can obtain Lambek residuated triple \,                 / and &acirc;&#128;&cent; of binary operators, and how the operators
            3                 and 2&acirc;&#134;&#147; introduced by Moortgat in [16] are indeed                 their unary counterpart. In the second
            part of the                 paper we turn to other important algebraic properties                 which are usually investigated
            in conjunction with                 residuation [5]: Galois and dual Galois connections.                 Again, DC let us
            readily define logic calculi capturing                 them, and we will discuss different possibilities in              
              which the logic operators so obtained can interact with                 those obtained from residuation. We also provide
                            preliminary ideas on how to use them when modeling                 linguistic phenomena.
