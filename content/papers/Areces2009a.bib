  abstract =     "Memory logics are modal logics whose semantics is
                 specified in terms of relational models enriched with
                 additional data structure to represent memory. The
                 logical language is then extended with a collection of
                 operations to access and modify the data structure. In
                 this paper we study their satisfiability and the model
                 checking problems. We first give sound and complete
                 tableaux calculi for the memory logic  (k, r, e)
                 (the basic modal language extended with the operator r
                 used to memorize a state, the operator e used to wipe
                 out the memory, and the operator k used to check if the
                 current point of evaluation is memorized) and some of
                 its sublanguages. As the satisfiability problem of
                  (k, r, e) is undecidable, the tableau calculus
                 we present is non terminating. Hence, we furthermore
                 study a variation that ensures termination, at the
                 expense of completeness, and we use model checking to
                 ensure soundness. Secondly, we show that the model
                 checking problem is PSpace-complete.",
