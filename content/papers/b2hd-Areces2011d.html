         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Combination of decision procedures is at the heart of Satisfiability	Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers. It provides ways to compose
            decision	procedures for expressive languages which mix symbols from various	decidable theories. Typical combinations include
            (linear) arithmetic,	uninterpreted symbols, arrays operators, etc. In [7] we showed that	any first-order theory from the Bernays-Schonfinkel-Ramsey
            fragment,	the two variable fragment, or the monadic fragment can be combined	with virtually any other decidable theory. Here,
            we complete the	picture by considering the Ackermann fragment, and several guarded	fragments. All theories in these fragments
            can be combined with other	decidable (combinations of) theories, with only minor restrictions.	In particular, it is not required
            for these other theories to be	stably-infinite.
