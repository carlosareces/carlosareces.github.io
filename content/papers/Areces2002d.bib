  abstract =     "We provide a detailed analysis of very weak fragments
                 of modal logics. Our fragments lack connectives that
                 introduce non-determinism and they feature restrictions
                 on the modal operators, which may lead to substantial
                 reductions in complexity. Our main result is a general
                 game-based characterization of the expressive power of
                 our fragments over the class of finite structures.",
