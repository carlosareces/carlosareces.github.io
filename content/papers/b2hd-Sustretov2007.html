         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">This paper discusses two experiments in theorem                 proving for hybrid logic under the topological           
            interpre- tation. We begin by discussing the                 topological interpretation of hybrid logic and noting       
            what it adds to the topological interpretation of                 orthodox modal logic. We then examine two implemented  
                         proof methods. The first makes use of HyLoBan, a                 terminating theorem prover that searches for
            a winning                 search strategy in certain topologically motivated                 games. The second is a translation-based
            approach that                 makes use of HyLoTab [17], a tableaux-based theorem                 prover for hybrid logic
            under the standard relational                 interpretation. We compare the two methods, and note a                 number
            of directions for further work.
