  abstract =     "Given a logic L, the L-Definability Problem for finite
                 structures takes as input a finite structure A and a
                 target relation T over the domain of A, and determines
                 whether there is a formula of L whose interpretation in
                 A coincides with T. In this note we present an
                 algorithm that solves the definability problem for
                 quantifier-free first order formulas. Our algorithm
                 takes advantage of a semantic characterization of open
                 definability via subisomorphisms, which is sound and
                 complete. We also provide an empirical evaluation of
                 its performance.",
