  abstract         = {We investigate labeled resolution calculi for hybrid logics with inference
	rules
	restricted via selection functions and orders. We start by providing
	a sound and refutationally
	complete calculus for the hybrid logic H(@, \downarrow, A), even under
	restrictions by selection
	functions and orders. Then, by imposing further restrictions in the
	original calculus, we
	develop a sound, complete and terminating calculus for the H (@) sublanguage.
	The proof
	scheme we use to show refutational completeness of these calculi is
	an adaptation of a
	standard completeness proof for saturation-based calculi for first-order
	logic that guarantees
	completeness even under redundancy elimination. In fact, one of the
	contributions of this
	article is to show that the general framework of saturation-based
	proving for first-order logic
	with equality can be naturally adapted to saturation-based calculi
	for other languages, in
	particular modal and hybrid logics.},
