         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We introduce a novel semantics for a multi-agent                 epistemic operator of knowing how, based on an          
            indistinguishability relation between plans. Our                 proposal is, arguably, closer to the standard           
            presentation of knowing that modalities in classical                 epistemic logic. We study the relationship between this
            new semantics and previous approaches, showing that our                 setting is general enough to capture them. We also
                            study the logical properties of the new semantics.                 First, we define a sound and complete axiomatization.
                            Second, we define a suitable notion of bisimulation and                 prove correspondence theorems. Finally,
            we investigate                 the computational complexity of the model checking and                 satisfiability problems
            for the new logic.
