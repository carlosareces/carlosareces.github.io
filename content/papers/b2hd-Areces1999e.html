         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We present a formal model for the specification of                 tele- phone features by means of description logics.  
            Our frame- work permits the formal definition of the                 basic telephone system as well as the specification of
              additional features (Call Waiting, Call Forwarding,                 etc.). Furthermore, by using standard reasoning tasks
                            from Description Logics, properties of features can be                 formally proved and interac- tions
            detected. An EXPTIME                 upper bound for the complex- ity of detecting feature                 interaction as
            a satisfiability problem is provided by                 exploiting well-known results for expressive                 description
            languages.
