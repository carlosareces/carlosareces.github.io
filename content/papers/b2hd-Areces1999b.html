         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Hybrid languages are extended modal languages which                 can refer to (or even quantify over) states. Such    
            languages are better behaved proof theoretically than                 ordinary modal languages for they internalize the  
            apparatus of labeled deduction. Moreover, they arise                 naturally in a variety of applications, including   
            description logic and temporal reason- ing. Thus it                 would be useful to have a map of their               
            complexity-theoretic properties, and this paper                 provides one. Our work falls into two parts. We first    
            examine the basic hybrid lan- guage and its multi-modal                 and tense logical cousins. We show that the basic
            hybrid language (and indeed, multi-modal hybrid                 languages) are no more complex than ordinary uni-modal   
                         logic: all have pspace-complete K-satisfiability                 problems. We then show that adding even one
            nominal to                 tense logic raises complexity from pspace to exptime.                 In the second part we turn
            to stronger hybrid languages                 in which it is possible to bind nom- inals. We prove a                 general
            expressivity result showing that even the weak                 form of binding offered by the \downarrow operator        
                    easily leads to undecidability.
