         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">The poison game is a two-player zero-sum game played                 on directed graphs, first introduced by Duchet and  
            Meyniel (1993) in the context of graph theory, where                 one of the players travels along the edges of a graph,
            while the other modifies the underlying structure by                 marking vertices. In this paper, we investigate the 
            poison game from the perspective of modal logic, as a                 natural case study of the use of modal languages   
            equipped with model-changing operators to describe                 evolving relational structures. In particular, to model
            the poison game, we consider three memory logics of                 decreasing expressive power but increasing fit with the
            game. We begin with ML\emptyset, the basic memory logic                 restricted to the initial class of models with an
            empty                 memory (see Areces et al. 2011). We then identify two                 fragments of ML\emptyset, which
            we respectively, denote                 as PML and PSL, and whose modal operators capture                 operations on models
            that mimic more closely the moves                 of both players. We show that these logics form a chain                
            in expressive power with PML &lt; ML\emptyset, and we                 introduce suitable notions of bisimulation for the two
                            new logics presented in this paper. We then show that                 model checking for both PML and PSL
            is PSPACE-complete.                 The construction also establishes that determining the                 existence of a
            winning strategy in the poison game is                 PSPACE-hard. We conclude by proving that PML, while               
             strictly less expressive than ML\emptyset, nonetheless                 has an undecidable satisfiability problem.
