  abstract         = {Many description logics (DLs) combine knowledge representation on
	an abstract, logical level with an interface to 'concrete' domains
	like numbers and strings with built-in predicates such as >, +, and
	prefix-of. These hybrid DLs have turned out to be useful in several
	application areas, such as reasoning about conceptual database models.
	We propose to further extend such DLs with key constraints that allow
	the expression of statements like 'US citizens are uniquely identified
	by their social security number'. Based on this idea, we introduce
	a number of natural description logics and perform a detailed analysis
	of their decidability and computational complexity. It turns out
	that naive extensions with key constraints easily lead to undecidability,
	whereas more careful extensions yield NExpTime-complete DLs for a
	variety of useful concrete domains.},
