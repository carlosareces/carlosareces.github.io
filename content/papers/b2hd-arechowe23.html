         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We investigate the complexity of the satisfiability                 problem for a modal logic expressing `knowing how'   
                         assertions, related to an agent's abilities to achieve                 a certain goal. We take one of the most
            standard                 semantics for this kind of logics based on linear                 plans. Our main result is a proof
            that checking                 satisfiability of a `knowing how' formula can be done                 in $&Icirc;&pound;_2^P$. The algorithm
            we present relies on                 eliminating nested modalities in a formula, and then                 performing multiple
            calls to a satisfiability checking                 oracle for propositional logic.
