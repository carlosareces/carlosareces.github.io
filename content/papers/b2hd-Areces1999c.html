         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Hybrid languages are extended modal languages which                 can refer to (or even quantify over) worlds. The use of
            strong hybrid languages dates back to at least [Pri67],                 but recent work (for example [BS98, BT99]) has focussed
            on a more constrained system called H(\downarrow, @).                 The purpose of the present paper is to show in detail
                            that H(\dowarrow, @) is a modally natural system. We                 study its expressivity, and provide both
            model                 theoretic characterizations (via a restricted notion of                 Ehrenfeucht-Fra&Auml;&plusmn;&Igrave;&#136;ss&Atilde;&copy; game,
            and an enriched notion of                 bisimulation) and a syntactic characterization (in                 terms of bounded
            formulas). The key result is that                 H(\downarrow, @) corresponds precisely to the                 first-order
            fragment which is invariant for generated                 submodels.
