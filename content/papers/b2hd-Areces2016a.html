         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Relation-changing modal logics are extensions of the                 basic modal logic that allow changes to the         
                   accessibility relation of a model during the evaluation                 of a formula. In particular, they are equipped
            with                 dynamic modalities that are able to delete, add, and                 swap edges in the model, both locally
            and globally. We                 provide translations from these logics to hybrid logic                 along with an implementation.
            In general, these logics                 are undecidable, but we use our translations to                 identify decidable
            fragments. We also compare the                 expressive power of relation-changing modal logics with                 hybrid
            logics.
