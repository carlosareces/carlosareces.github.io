         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Relation-changing modal logics are extensions of the basic modal logic	that allow changes to the accessibility relation of
            a model during	the evaluation of a formula. In particular, they are equipped with	dynamic modalities that are able to delete,
            add, and swap edges in	the model, both locally and globally. We provide translations from	these logics to hybrid logic along
            with an implementation. In general,	these logics are undecidable, but we use our translations to identify	decidable fragments.
            We also compare the expressive power of relation-changing	modal logics with hybrid logics.
