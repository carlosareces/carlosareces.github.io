         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Current classical planners are very successful in                 finding (non-optimal) plans, even for large planning   
            instances. To do so, most planners rely on a                 preprocessing stage that computes a grounded                
            representation of the task. Whenever the grounded task                 is too big to be generated (i.e., whenever this   
                         preprocess fails) the instance cannot even be tackled                 by the actual planner. To address this
            issue, we                 introduce a partial grounding approach that grounds                 only a projection of the task,
            when complete grounding                 is not feasible. We propose a guiding mechanism that,                 for a given
            domain, identifies the parts of a task that                 are relevant to find a plan by using off-the-shelf           
                 machine learning methods. Our empirical evaluation                 attests that the approach is capable of solving  
                          planning instances that are too big to be fully                 grounded.
