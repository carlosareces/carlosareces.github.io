         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Relation-changing modal logics are extensions of the                 basic modal logic that allow to change the          
                  accessibility relation of a model during the evaluation                 of a formula. In particular, they are equipped
            with                 dynamic modalities that are able to delete, add and                 swap edges in the model, both locally
            and globally. We                 investigate the satisfiability problem of these logics.                 We define satisfiability-preserving
            translations from                 an undecidable memory logic to relation-changing modal                 logics. This way
            we show that their satisfiability                 problems are undecidable.
