         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We present a coinductive definition of models for                 modal logics and show that it provides a homogeneous   
            framework in which it is possible to include different                 modal languages ranging from classical modalities to
            operators from hybrid and memory logics. Moreover,                 results that had to be proved separately for each     
            different language --but whose proofs were known to be                 mere routine-- now can be proved in a general way.
            We                 show, for example, that we can have a unique definition                 of bisimulation for all these languages,
            and prove a                 single invariance-under-bisimulation theorem. We then                 use the new framework to
            investigate normal forms for                 modal logics. The normal form we introduce may have a                 smaller
            modal depth than the original formula, and it                 is inspired by global modalities like the universal        
            modality and the satisfiability operator from hybrid                 logics. These modalities can be extracted from under
            the scope of other operators. We provide a general                 definition of extractable modalities and show how to  
               compute extracted normal forms. As it is the case with                 other classical normal forms --e.g., the conjunctive
                            normal form of propositional logic-- the extracted                 normal form of a formula can be exponentially
            bigger                 than the original formula, if we require the two                 formulas to be equivalent. If we only
            require                 equi-satisfiability, then every modal formula has an                 extracted normal form which is
            only polynomially bigger                 than the original formula, and it can be computed in                 polynomial time.
