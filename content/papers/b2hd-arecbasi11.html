         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Memory logics is a family of modal logics whose semantics is specified	in terms of relational models enriched with additional
            data structure	to represent a memory. The logical language includes a collection	of operations to access and modify the data
            structure. In this paper	we study basic model properties of memory logics, and prove results	concerning characterization,
            definability and interpolation. While	the first two properties hold for all memory logics introduced in	this article, interpolation
            fails in most cases.
