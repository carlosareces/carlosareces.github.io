  abstract =     "Due to the concatenative interpretation of its
                 composition operator, the base categorial type logic
                 \NLd encounters some difficulties when analyzing
                 non-concatenative material. Hence, modeling linguistic
                 phenomena like anaphora resolution, long distance
                 binding, gapping, discontinuity and quantifier raising
                 becomes a problem in this logic. We propose an
                 extension of \NLd with hybrid operators (nominals and
                 the \,:-operator), and show that this extension has the
                 needed expressivity to define frame classes leading to
                 a proper modeling of long distance binding. We focus
                 our presentation on the treatment of quantifier
                 phrases.",
