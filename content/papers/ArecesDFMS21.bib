  abstract =     "In this article we present a modal logic that extends
                 the basic modal logic ML with two dynamic operators:
                 copy (cp), which replicates the current model,
                 labelling each copy with a different propositional
                 symbol and respecting accessibility relations even
                 between distinct copies; and remove (rm), which deletes
                 paths in the model that satify certain intermediate
                 conditions. We call the resulting logic ML(cp, rm). We
                 study its computational complexity, and its relative
                 expressivity with respect to (static) modal logics ML
                 and ML(âˆ’), and the dynamic epistemic Action Model
