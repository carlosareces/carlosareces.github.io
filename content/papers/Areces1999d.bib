  abstract =     "We present a formal model for the specification of
                 telephone features by means of description logics. Our
                 framework permits the formal definition of the basic
                 telephone system as well as the specification of
                 additional features. By using standard techniques from
                 description logic reasoning, properties of features can
                 be proved and interactions detected. An ExpTime upper
                 bound for the complexity of detecting feature
                 interaction as a satisfiability problem is obtained by
                 well known results for expressive description
                 languages.",
