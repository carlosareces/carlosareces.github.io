         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">In this study we propose the standard modal logic KDC4                 as the logic governing expressions about Utopia. We
            define a formal construction corresponding to Utopian                 expressions in ordinary language that we name utopian
            conditionals. They possess the singular properties of                 admitting Strengthening of the Antecedent while    
                        possibly defeating the rule of Modus Ponens. Perhaps                 the most interesting aspect of this work
            is that, as                 far as the authors know, this is the first time a                 category of expressions in the
            ordinary language                 corresponding to these two singular properties is                 provided.
