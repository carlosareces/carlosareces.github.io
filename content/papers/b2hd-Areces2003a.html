         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We consider description logic knowledge bases in which                 the ABox can contain Boolean combinations of      
                      traditional ABox assertions (represented as clauses or                 sequents). A linear reduction of such knowledge
            bases                 into a standard format (al- lowing only conjunctive                 assertions) is described which preserves
            knowledge base                 satisfiability. Similar results are presented for                 Boolean TBoxes and Boolean
            com- binations of both ABox                 and TBox statements.
