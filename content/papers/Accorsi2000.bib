  abstract =     "We report on ongoing work on using a constraint-based
                 approach towards fature interaction detection.
                 Constraint programming is introduced as a natural way
                 of handling the inherent non-monotonic aspects of
                 feature integration. Starting from a logic
                 specification of the Basic Call Service (BCS), we
                 obtain a labeled transition system rerpresenting this
                 service. This graphical interpretation is implemented
                 in smodels and tested for a variety of properties. We
                 have devised a stepwise methodology for integrating
                 features. Acoording to our method, geatures act as
                 constraints on models of the original basic system. On
                 the one hand they forbid some of the original behaviour
                 of the system (thus pruning some models), and on the
                 other hey give rise to new models, representing new
                 behavior. Using this methodology, we have so far
                 implemented a small number of features on top of the
                 basic call service, and we report on some of the tests
                 that we have performed.",
