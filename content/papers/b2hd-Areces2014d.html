         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We investigate dynamic modal operators that can change the model during	evaluation. We define the logic SL by extending the
            basic modal language	with the $\swap$ modality, which is a diamond operator that in addition	has the ability to invert pairs
            of related elements in the domain	while traversing an edge of the accessibility relation. SL is very	expressive: it fails
            to have the finite and the tree model property.	We show that SL is equivalent to a fragment of first-order logic	by providing
            a satisfiability preserving translation. In addition,	we provide an equivalence preserving translation from SL to the hybrid	logic
            H(:, $\downarrow$). We also define a suitable notion of bisimulation	for SL and investigate its expressive power, showing
            that it lies	strictly between the basic modal logic and H(:, $\downarrow$). We	finally show that its model checking problem
            is PSpace-complete and	its satisfiability problem is undecidable.
