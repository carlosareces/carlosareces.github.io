         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We investigate dynamic modal operators that can change                 the model during evaluation. We define the logic SL
            by                 extending the basic modal language with the $\swap$                 modality, which is a diamond operator
            that in addition                 has the ability to invert pairs of related elements in                 the domain while traversing
            an edge of the                 accessibility relation. SL is very expressive: it fails                 to have the finite
            and the tree model property. We show                 that SL is equivalent to a fragment of first-order                 logic
            by providing a satisfiability preserving                 translation. In addition, we provide an equivalence             
            preserving translation from SL to the hybrid logic H(:,                 $\downarrow$). We also define a suitable notion of
                            bisimulation for SL and investigate its expressive                 power, showing that it lies strictly between
            the basic                 modal logic and H(:, $\downarrow$). We finally show                 that its model checking problem
            is PSpace-complete and                 its satisfiability problem is undecidable.
