  abstract =     "We introduce a modal language for reasoning about data
                 graphs with incomplete information. Such data graphs
                 are formally represented as models in which data value
                 functions are partial to capture what is unknown. In
                 this setting, we also allow for unknown data values to
                 be learned. Our main result is a sound and strongly
                 complete axiomatization for the logic.",
