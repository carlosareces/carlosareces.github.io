         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">In this paper we introduce a sound and complete                 axiomatization for XPath with data constraints extended  
            with hybrid operators. First, we define                 HXPath_=(\down\up), an extension of vertical XPath with          
                  nominals and the hybrid operator @. Then, we introduce                 an axiomatic system for HXPath_=(\down\up), and
            we                 prove it is complete with respect to the class of                 abstract data trees, i.e., data trees
            in which data                 values are abstracted as equivalence relations. As a                 corollary, we also obtain
            completeness with respect to                 the class of concrete data trees.
