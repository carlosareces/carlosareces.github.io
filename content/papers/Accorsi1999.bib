  abstract =     "In this paper we propose a new approach to the problem
                 of detecting feature interactions based on the stable
                 models semantics for logical programs. Starting from a
                 formal definition of a model of the Basic Call System,
                 we encode the allowed actions and transitions by means
                 of rules in the style of Reiter' s defaults. We can
                 then use tools like smodels to perform tasks like
                 verification and testing.",
