         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We approach the concept of Pivotal Rule Consequence                 (PRC) proposed in [14,15] from a semantical          
            perspective, resorting to model updates in Public                 Announcement Logic (PAL) [17]. In doing this, we take  
            inspiration from the notion of dynamic consequence from                 [3,6]. Our perspective gains in interest since PRC
            serves as a bridge from Classical Logic to Default                 Logic one of the most well-known non-monotonic        
                    formalisms. We show how the internalization of PRC in                 PAL leads to clear semantics of the former,
            and to                 completeness and transfer results. Moreover, we address                 the case of credulous consequence
            in Default Logic as a                 particular case of PRC. Interestingly, we cast                 credulous consequence
            as a model checking problem. We                 argue that our results open the way to use well-known                 semantic
            tools from modal logic to study properties of                 different non-monotonic logics.
