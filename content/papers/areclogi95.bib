  abstract         = {In this study we propose the standard modal logic KDC4 as the logic
	governing expressions about Utopia. We define a formal construction
	corresponding to Utopian expressions in ordinary language that we
	name utopian conditionals. They possess the singular properties of
	admitting Strengthening of the Antecedent while possibly defeating
	the rule of Modus Ponens. Perhaps the most interesting aspect of
	this work is that, as far as the authors know, this is the first
	time a category of expressions in the ordinary language corresponding
	to these two singular properties is provided.},
