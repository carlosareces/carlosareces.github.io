  abstract =     "We approach the concept of Pivotal Rule Consequence
                 (PRC) proposed in [14,15] from a semantical
                 perspective, resorting to model updates in Public
                 Announcement Logic (PAL) [17]. In doing this, we take
                 inspiration from the notion of dynamic consequence from
                 [3,6]. Our perspective gains in interest since PRC
                 serves as a bridge from Classical Logic to Default
                 Logic one of the most well-known non-monotonic
                 formalisms. We show how the internalization of PRC in
                 PAL leads to clear semantics of the former, and to
                 completeness and transfer results. Moreover, we address
                 the case of credulous consequence in Default Logic as a
                 particular case of PRC. Interestingly, we cast
                 credulous consequence as a model checking problem. We
                 argue that our results open the way to use well-known
                 semantic tools from modal logic to study properties of
                 different non-monotonic logics.",
