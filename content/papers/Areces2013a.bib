  abstract =     "We consider dynamic modal operators that can change
                 the relation of a model during the evaluation of a
                 formula. In particular, we extend the basic modal
                 language with modalities that are able to delete, add
                 or swap pairs of related elements of the domain. In
                 this paper, we explore tableau calculi as
                 satisfiability and model building procedures for these
                 logics.",
