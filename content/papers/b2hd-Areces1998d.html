         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We consider two recently proposed defini- tions of the                 expressive power of description logics, one due to
                            Baader, the other due to Kurtonina and de Rijke. The                 proposals are non-equivalent, and we
            explain their                 differences, similarities, as well as ways in which                 they are related. We also
            map out a research agenda                 resulting from efforts to combine the two approaches.
