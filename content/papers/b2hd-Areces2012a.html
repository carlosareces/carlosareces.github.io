         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Memory logics are a family of modal logics in which standard relational	structures are augmented with data structures and
            additional operations	to modify and query these structures. In this paper we present sound	and complete axiomatizations for
            some members of this family. We	analyze the use of nominals to achieve completeness, and present	one example in which they
            can be avoided.
