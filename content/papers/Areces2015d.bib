  abstract         = {In this paper we develop the theoretical foundations to exploit symmetries
	in modal logics. We generalize the notion of symmetries of propositional
	formulas in conjunctive normal form to modal formulas using the framework
	provided by coinductive modal models introduced in [1].Hence, the
	results apply to a wide class of modal logics including, for example,
	hybrid logics. We present two graph constructions that enable the
	reduction of symmetry detection in modal formulas to the graph automorphism
	detection problem, and we evaluate the graph constructions on modal
	benchmarks.},
