         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Hybrid Logics are usually presented as an extension of                 modal logics where we can explicitly refer to the 
            elements in the model. In this paper we will start by                 introducing hybrid logics from that perspective, and
            we                 will complete this presentation with a historical                 overview. But we will later have a closer
            look to the                 &acirc;&#134;&#147; binder, and propose an alternative way to think                 about it. We will explain
            then how, in this new light,                 a whole new spectrum of logical languages is offered to                 the enterprising
            logician.
