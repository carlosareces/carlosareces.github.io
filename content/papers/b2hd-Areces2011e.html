         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We investigate labeled resolution calculi for hybrid logics with inference	rules	restricted via selection functions and orders.
            We start by providing	a sound and refutationally	complete calculus for the hybrid logic H(@, \downarrow, A), even under	restrictions
            by selection	functions and orders. Then, by imposing further restrictions in the	original calculus, we	develop a sound, complete
            and terminating calculus for the H (@) sublanguage.	The proof	scheme we use to show refutational completeness of these calculi
            is	an adaptation of a	standard completeness proof for saturation-based calculi for first-order	logic that guarantees	completeness
            even under redundancy elimination. In fact, one of the	contributions of this	article is to show that the general framework
            of saturation-based	proving for first-order logic	with equality can be naturally adapted to saturation-based calculi	for other
            languages, in	particular modal and hybrid logics.
