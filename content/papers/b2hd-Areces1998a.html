         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We provide two di erent model theoretic                 characterizations of a new fragment of first-order               
             logic which we call d-Horn formulas. This fragment is                 dual to the well know Horn fragment and have the same
                            complexity for provability. The method used in the                 characterization (syntactic translation
            functions                 between formulas which are mimicked by translation                 functions between models) might
            be applied to                 characterize other first-order restrictions.
