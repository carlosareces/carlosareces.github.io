  abstract         = {We present iSat, a Python command line tool to analyze and find structure
	in propositional satisfiability problems. iSat offers an interactive
	shell to control propositional solvers and generate graph representations
	of the internal structure of the search space explored by them for
	visualization, with the final aim of providing a unified environment
	for propositional solving experimentation. iSat was designed to allow
	the simple integration of both new provers and new visualizationgraphs
	and statistics with a minimum of coding overhead.},
