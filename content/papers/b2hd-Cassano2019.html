         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We investigate interpolation and Beth definability in                 default logics. To this end, we start by defining a
            general framework which is sufficiently abstract to                 encompass most of the usual definitions of a default 
                     Logic. In this framework a default logic DL is built on                 a base, monotonic, logic L. We then investigate
            the                 question of when interpolation and Beth definability                 results transfer from L to DL. This
            investigation needs                 suitable notions of interpolation and Beth definability                 for default logics.
            We show both positive and negative                 general results: depending on how DL is defined and of                
            the kind of interpolation/Beth definability involved,                 the property might or might not transfer from L to 
                           DL.
