         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Hybrid languages are modal languages that have special                 symbols for naming individual states in models. Their
            history can be traced back to work of Arthur Prior in                 the fifties. The subject has recently regained     
            interest, resulting in many new results and techniques.                 This chapter contains a modern overview of the field.
                            We sketch its history, and survey the basic properties                 of various hybrid languages, focussing
            on model theory                 (completeness, expressivity, definability,                 interpolation), decidability and
            complexity, and proof                 theory. We also discuss a number of connections with                 other fields.
