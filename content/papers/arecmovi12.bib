  abstract         = {We study dynamic modal operators that can change themodel during the
	evaluation of a formula. In particular, we extend thebasic modal
	language with diamond modalities that are able to swap, delete or
	add pairs of related elements of the domain, while traversing an
	edge of the accessibility relation. We study these languages together
	with the sabotage modal logic, which can arbitrarily delete edges
	of the model. We define a suitable notion of bisimulation for the
	basic modal logic extended with each of the new dynamic operators
	and investigate their expressive power, showing that they are all
	uncomparable. We also show that the complexity of their model checking
	problems is PSpace- complete.},
