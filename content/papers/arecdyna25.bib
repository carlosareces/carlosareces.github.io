  abstract = "We investigate dynamic operations acting over a knowing how logic. Our ap-
proach uses a recently introduced semantics for the knowing how operator, which
is based on an indistinguishability relation between plans, and which is arguably
closer to the standard presentation of knowing that modalities in classic epis-
temic logic. Here, we discuss how the new indistinguishability-based semantics
enables us to define dynamic modalities representing different ways in which an
agent can learn how to achieve a goal. In this regard, we study different alterna-
tives for implementing two types of updates: ontic and epistemic. For the former,
we provide axiomatizations over a restricted class of models. For the latter, we
investigate some semantic properties and discuss what the difficulties are in ax-
iomatizing dynamic modalities. In turn, we introduce a novel dynamic epistemic
modality for which we have reduction axioms over an extended static knowing
how language.",
