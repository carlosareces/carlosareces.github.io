  abstract =     "A notation to describe software system designs is
                 given together with the means to verify properties over
                 them. De- signs are considered as models of a modal
                 logic. The pro- cedure to derive the modal model
                 associated to a design, the algorithm to check
                 properties over a model, the method to de ne new
                 relations and the method of model ltration are
                 presented. The proposed logic (KPI a poly-modal logic
                 with inverse operators) is used as a property speci
                 cation language veri ed through a model checking
                 algorithm. The methods provided proved to be e ective
                 and simple to im- plement. A prototype tool has been
                 developed in SML-NJ covering all functionalities
                 described.",
