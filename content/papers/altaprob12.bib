  abstract         = {We propose an algorithm for the generation of referring expressions
	that adapts the approach of Areces et al. (2008, 2011) to include
	overspecification and probabilities learned from corpora. After introducing
	the algorithm, we discuss how probabilities required as input can
	be computed for any given domain for which a suitable corpus of REs
	is available, and how the probabilities can be adjusted for new scenes
	in the domain using a machine learning approach. We exemplify how
	to compute probabilities over the GRE3D7 corpus of Viethen (2011).
	The resulting algorithm is able to generate different referring expressions
	for the same target with a frequency similar to that observed in
	corpora. We empirically evaluate the new algorithm over the GRE3D7
	corpus, and show that the probability distribution of the generated
	referring expressions match the one found in the corpus with high
	accuracy.},
