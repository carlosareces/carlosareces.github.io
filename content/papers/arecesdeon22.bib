  abstract =     "We introduce a logic for representing the deontic
                 notion of knowingly complying –associated to an
                 agent’s conciousness of taking a normative course of
                 action for achieving a certain goal. Our logic features
                 an operator for describing normative courses of
                 actions, and another operator for describing what each
                 agent knowingly complies with. We provide a sound and
                 complete axiom system for our logic, and study the
                 computational complexity of its satisfiability problem.
                 Finally, we extend our logic with an additional
                 operator for capturing the general abilities of the
                 agents. This operator enables us to distinguish ‘what
                 agents can do’ and ‘what agents do according to
                 norms’. For this extension, we also provide a sound
                 and complete axiom system.",
