         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">The hybrid logic H(@) is obtained by adding nominals                 and the satisfaction operator @ to the basic modal  
            logic. The resulting logic gains expressive power                 without increasing the complexity of the satisfiability
            problem, which remains within PSpace. A resolution                 calculus for H(@) was introduced in [5], but it did not
            provide strategies for ordered resolution and selection                 functions. Additionally, the problem of termination
            was                 left open. In this paper we address both issues. We                 first define proper notions of admissible
            orderings and                 selection functions and prove the refutational                 completeness of the obtained
            ordered resolution                 calculus using a standard &acirc;&#128;&#156;candidate model&acirc;&#128;&#157;                 construction [10]. Next,
            we refine some of the                 nominal-handling rules and show that the resulting                 calculus is sound,
            complete and can only generate a                 finite number of clauses, establishing termination.                 Finally,
            the theoretical results were tested                 empirically by implementing the new strategies into                 HyLoRes
            [6, 18], an experimental prototype for the                 original calculus described in [5]. Both versions of          
                  the prover were compared and we discuss some                 preliminary results.
