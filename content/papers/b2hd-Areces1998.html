         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">The AGM model has been criticized for not addressing                 the problem of iterated change. This is true, but in
            some cases the invalid claim that AGM does not allow                 iteration has been made. In this paper we examine   
            the most elementary scheme of iteration: an iterable                 function. We formulate an iterable version of the AGM
            model, showing that the AGM formalism is in fact                 compatible with iteration. Following Alchourron and     
                       Makinson's early reference to an iterable form of a                 safe contraction function, we give an iterable
                            construction for each of the ve AGM presentations (meet                 functions, systems of spheres, postulates,
            epistemic                 entrenchments and safe hierarchies) and prove their                 equivalence.
