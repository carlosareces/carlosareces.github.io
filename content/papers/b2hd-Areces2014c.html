         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We propose a logic with the dynamic modal operators                 copy and remove. The copy operator replicates a given
                            model, and the remove operator removes paths in a given                 model. We show that the product update
            by an action                 model (with Boolean pre-conditions) in dynamic                 epistemic logic decomposes in
            copy and remove                 operations. We also show that copy and remove operators                 (of path of length
            1) can be expressed by action                 models. We investigate the complexity of the                 satisfiability
            problem of syntactic fragments of the                 logic with copy and remove operations.
