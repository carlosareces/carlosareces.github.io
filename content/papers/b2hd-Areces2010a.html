         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We present a modal language that includes explicit operators to count	the number of elements that a model might include in
            the extension	of a formula, and we discuss how this logic has been previously investigated	under different guises. We show
            that the language is related to graded	modalities and to hybrid logics. We illustrate a possible application	of the language
            to the treatment of plural objects and queries in	natural language. We investigate the expressive power of this logic	via
            bisimulations, discuss the complexity of its satisfiability problem,	define a new reasoning task that retrieves the cardinality
            bound	of the extension of a given input formula, and provide an algorithm	to solve it.
