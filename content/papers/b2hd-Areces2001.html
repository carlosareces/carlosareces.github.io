         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">The AGM model [Alchourr&Atilde;&sup3;n et al., 1985] has been                 criticized for not ad- dressing the problem of iterated
            change. This is true, but in some cases the invalid                 claim that &acirc;&#128;&#156;AGM does not allow iteration&acirc;&#128;&#157; has been
            made. In this paper we examine the most elementary                 scheme of iteration: a binary operation * defined for 
                           any theory K and any formula &Icirc;&plusmn;. We naturally extend                 the AGM model showing that it is in fact
            compatible                 with iteration. Following Alchourr&Atilde;&sup3;n and Makinson&acirc;&#128;&#153;s                 early reference to an iterated
            form of the safe                 contraction function, we provide extended constructions                 for each of the five
            AGM presentations (meet functions,                 systems of spheres, postulates, epistemic entrenchments               
             and safe hierarchies) and prove their equivalence.
