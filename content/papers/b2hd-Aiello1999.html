         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Building upon the description logic of concrete                 domains introduced by Baader and Hanschke, we provide a  
                          system which is aimed at enhancing image retrieval with                 the ability to perform spatial reasoning.
            In this early                 stage of our research we focus on obtaining a formalism                 which is expressive
            enough to increase the usefulness                 of expensive pictur description (commin in content                 based
            image retrieval systems) by means ofj89 spatial                 reasoning.
