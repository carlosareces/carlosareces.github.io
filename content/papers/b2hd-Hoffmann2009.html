         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Hybrid logic is a formalism that is closely related to                 both modal logic and description logic. A variety of
            proof mechanisms for hybrid logic exist, but the only                 widely available implemented proof system, HyLoRes,
            is                 based on the resolution method. An alternative to                 resolution is the tableaux method, already
            widely used                 for both modal and description logics. Tableaux                 algorithms have also been developed
            for a number of                 hybrid logics, and the goal of the present work is to                 implement one of them.
            In this article we present the                 implementation of a terminating tableaux algorithm for                 the
            basic hybrid logic. The performance of the tableaux                 algorithm is compared with the performances of HyLoRes
                            and HyLoTab (a system based on a different tableaux                 algorithm). HTab is implemented in the
            functional                 language Haskell, using the Glasgow Haskell Compiler                 (GHC). The code is released
            under the GNU GPL and can                 be downloaded from                 http://trac.loria.fr/projects/htab.
