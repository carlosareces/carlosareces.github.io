  abstract =     "In this paper we introduce a sound and complete
                 axiomatization for XPath with data constraints extended
                 with hybrid operators. First, we define
                 HXPath_=(\down\up), an extension of vertical XPath with
                 nominals and the hybrid operator @. Then, we introduce
                 an axiomatic system for HXPath_=(\down\up), and we
                 prove it is complete with respect to the class of
                 abstract data trees, i.e., data trees in which data
                 values are abstracted as equivalence relations. As a
                 corollary, we also obtain completeness with respect to
                 the class of concrete data trees.",
