         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We investigate dynamic operations acting over a knowing how logic. Our ap-proach uses a recently introduced semantics for
            the knowing how operator, whichis based on an indistinguishability relation between plans, and which is arguablycloser to
            the standard presentation of knowing that modalities in classic epis-temic logic. Here, we discuss how the new indistinguishability-based
            semanticsenables us to define dynamic modalities representing different ways in which anagent can learn how to achieve a goal.
            In this regard, we study different alterna-tives for implementing two types of updates: ontic and epistemic. For the former,we
            provide axiomatizations over a restricted class of models. For the latter, weinvestigate some semantic properties and discuss
            what the difficulties are in ax-iomatizing dynamic modalities. In turn, we introduce a novel dynamic epistemicmodality for
            which we have reduction axioms over an extended static knowinghow language.
