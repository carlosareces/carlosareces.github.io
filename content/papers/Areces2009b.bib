                 standard relational structures are augmented with data
                 structures and additional operations to modify and
                 query these structures. In this paper we present sound
                 and complete axiomatizations for some members of this
                 family. We analyze the use of nominals to achieve
                 completeness, and present one example in which they can
                 be avoided.",
