         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Memory logics is a family of modal logics whose                 semantics is specified in terms of relational models     
                       enriched with additional data structure to represent a                 memory. The logical language includes a
            collection of                 operations to access and modify the data structure. In                 this paper we study basic
            model properties of memory                 logics, and prove results concerning characterization,                 definability
            and interpolation. While the first two                 properties hold for all memory logics introduced in               
             this article, interpolation fails in most cases.
