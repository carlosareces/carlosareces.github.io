         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Three important results about the expressivity of a modal logic L	are the Characterization Theorem (that identifies a modal
            logic L	as a fragment of a better known logic), the Definability theorem	(that provides conditions under which a class of
            L-models can be	defined by a formula or a set of formulas of L), and the Separation	Theorem (that provides conditions under
            which two disjoint classes	of L-models can be separated by a class definable in L).	In this article we provide general conditions
            under which these results	can be established for a given choice of model class and modal language	whose expressivity is below
            first order logic. Besides some basic	constrains that most modal logics easily satisfy, the fundamental	condition that we
            require is that the class of omega-saturated models	in question has the Hennessy-Milner property with respect to the	notion
            of observational equivalence under consideration.	As the Characterization, Definability and Separation theorems are	among
            the cornerstones in the model theory of L, this property can	be seen as a test that identifies the adequate notion of observational	equivalence
            for a particular modal logic.
