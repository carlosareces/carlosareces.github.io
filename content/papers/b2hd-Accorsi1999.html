         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">In this paper we propose a new approach to the problem                 of detecting feature interactions based on the stable
                            models semantics for logical programs. Starting from a                 formal definition of a model of the
            Basic Call System,                 we encode the allowed actions and transitions by means                 of rules in the
            style of Reiter' s defaults. We can                 then use tools like smodels to perform tasks like                 verification
            and testing.
