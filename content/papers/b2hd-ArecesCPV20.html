         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">In this article we formally define and investigate the                 computational complexity of the Definability Problem
            for open first-order formulas (i.e., quantifier free                 first-order formulas) with equality. Given a logic L,
            the L-Definability Problem for finite structures takes                 as input a finite structure A and a target relation
            T                 over the domain of A, and determines whether there is a                 formula of L whose interpretation
            in A coincides with T                 . We show that the complexity of this problem for open                 first-order formulas
            (open definability, for short) is                 coNP- complete. We also investigate the parametric                 complexity
            of the prob- lem, and prove that if the size                 and the arity of the target relation T are taken as         
                   parameters then open definability is coW[1]-complete                 for every vocabulary &Iuml;&#132; with at least one, at
            least                 binary, relation.
