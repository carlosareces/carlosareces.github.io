         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Building on work by Schild, De Giacomo and Lenz-                 erini, we establish a tight connection between          
                  description logics and hybrid logics. The main aim of                 the paper is to provide a modal perspective on
            some of                 the distinguishing features of description logic. In                 particular, by working in a hybrid
            logic setting we are                 able to develop a model-theoretic understanding of both                 asser- tional
            and terminological information. We also                 show how to use the connection between description and           
                 hybrid logics to transfer results on complexity and                 expressive power from one to the other.
