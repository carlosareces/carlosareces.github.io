  abstract         = {We present three different techniques that use information about symmetries
	detected in the input formula to block the expansion of diamonds
	in a modal tableau. We show how these blocking techniques can be
	included in a standard tableaux calculus for the basic modal logic,
	and prove that they preserve soundness and completeness. We empirically
	evaluate these blocking mechanisms in different modal benchmarks.},
