  abstract =     "We present a formal model for the specification of
                 tele- phone features by means of description logics.
                 Our frame- work permits the formal definition of the
                 basic telephone system as well as the specification of
                 additional features (Call Waiting, Call Forwarding,
                 etc.). Furthermore, by using standard reasoning tasks
                 from Description Logics, properties of features can be
                 formally proved and interac- tions detected. An EXPTIME
                 upper bound for the complex- ity of detecting feature
                 interaction as a satisfiability problem is provided by
                 exploiting well-known results for expressive
                 description languages.",
