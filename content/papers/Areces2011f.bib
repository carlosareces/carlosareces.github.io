  abstract =     "In this article we first show how the functional and
                 the optimized functional translation from modal logic
                 to many-sorted first-order logic can be naturally
                 extended to the hybrid language H(@,\downarrow). The
                 translation is correct not only when reasoning over the
                 class of all models, but for any first-order definable
                 class. We then show that sorts can be safely removed
                 (i.e., without affecting the satisfiability status of
                 the formula) for frame classes that can be defined in
                 the basic modal language, and show a counterexample for
                 a frame class defined using nominals.",
