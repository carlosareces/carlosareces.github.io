         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Default Logics are a family of non-monotonic                 formalisms having so-called defaults and extensions as      
            their common foundation. Traditionally, default logics                 have been defined and dealt with via syntactic notions
            of consequence in propositional or first-order logic.                 Here, we build default logics on modal logics. First,
            we present these default logics syntactically. Then, we                 elaborate on an algebraic counterpart. More precisely,
            we extend the notion of a modal algebra to accommodate                 for defaults and extensions. Our algebraic view of
                            default logics concludes with an algebraic completeness                 result and a way of comparing default
            logics borrowing                 ideas from the concept of bisimulation in modal logic.                 To our knowledge,
            this take on default logics approach                 is novel. Interestingly, it also lays the groundwork                
            for studying default logics from a dynamic logic                 perspective.
