  abstract = {Modal logics extend classical propositional logic, and they are robustly
	decidable. Whereas most existing decision procedures for modal logics
	are based on tableau constructions, we propose a framework for obtaining
	decision procedures by adding instantiation rules to standard SAT
	and SMT solvers. Soundness, completeness, and termination of the
	procedures can be proved in a uniform and elementary way for the
	basic modal logic and some extensions.},
