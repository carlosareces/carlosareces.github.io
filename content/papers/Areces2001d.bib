                 the authors of this editorial had their way —
                 vice-versa. Strictly speaking, not all modal logics are
                 hybrid, but certainly any modal logics can be
                 hybridized, and in our view many of them should be.
                 What is it to hybridize a modal logic? To answer this
                 properly we need to step back a little and discuss
                 recent trends in modal logic.",
