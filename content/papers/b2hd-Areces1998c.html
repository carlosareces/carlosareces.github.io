         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">In this article we establish interpolation for the                 minimal system of interpretability logic . We prove   
            that arrow interpolation holds for and that turnstile                 interpolation and interpolation for the            
            \triangle-modality easily follow from this.                 Furthermore, these properties are extended to the            
            system . The related issue of Beth De nability is also                 addressed. As usual, the arrow interpolation property
                            implies the Beth property. From the latter it follows                 via an argumentation which is standard
            in provability                 logic, that has the xed point property. Finally we                 observe that a general result
            of Maksimova [11] for                 provability logics can be extended to interpretability                 logics, implying
            that all extensions of have the Beth                 property.
