  abstract =     "We investigate dynamic operations acting over a
                 knowing how logic. Our approach makes use of a recently
                 introduced semantics for the knowing how operator,
                 based on an indistinguishability relation between
                 plans. This semantics is arguably closer to the
                 standard presentation of knowing that modalities in
                 classic epistemic logic. Here, we discuss how the
                 semantics enables us to define dynamic modalities
                 representing different ways in which an agent can learn
                 how to achieve a goal. In this regard, we study two
                 types of updates: ontic updates (for which we provide
                 axiomatizations over a particular class of models), and
                 epistemic updates (for which we investigate some
                 semantic properties).",
