         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We generalize the notion of symmetries of                 propositional formulas in conjunctive normal form to           
                 modal formulas. Our framework uses the coinductive                 models introduced in [4] and, hence, the results apply
                            to a wide class of modal logics including, for example,                 hybrid logics. Our main result shows
            that the                 symmetries of a modal formula preserve entailment: if                 $\sigma$ is a symmetry of $\varphi$
            then $\varphi                 \models \psi$ if and only if $\varphi \models                 \sigma(\psi)$.
