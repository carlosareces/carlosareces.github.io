         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We present a technique that is able to detect symmetries in formulas	of the basic modal logic (BML). Then we introduce a modal
            tableaux	calculus for BML with a blocking mechanism that takes advantage of	symmetry information about the input formula to
            restrict the application	of the ($\Diamond$) rule. We prove completeness of the calculus.	Finally, we empirically evaluate
            both, the detection technique and	the blocking mechanism in different modal benchmarks.
