         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We investigate the expressive power of memory logics.                 These are modal logics extended with the possibility
            to                 store (or remove) the current node of evaluation in (or                 from) a memory, and to perform
            membership tests on the                 current memory. From this perspective, the hybrid logic                 HL(\downarrow),
            for example, can be thought of as a                 particular case of a memory logic where the memory is                
            an indexed list of elements of the domain. This work                 focuses in the case where the memory is a set, and we
            can test whether the current node belongs to the set or                 not. We prove that, in terms of expressive power,
            the                 memory logics we discuss here lie between the basic                 modal logic and HL(\downarrow). We
            show that the                 satisfiability problem of most of the logics we cover                 is undecidable. The only
            logic with a decidable                 satisfiability problem is obtained by imposing strong                 constraints on
            which elements can be memorized.
