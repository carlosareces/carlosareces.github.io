         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We provide a sound, complete and terminating tableau                 procedure to check satisfiability of downward XPath=
                            formulas enriched with nominals and satisfaction                 operators. The calculus is inspired by ideas
            introduced                 to ensure termination of tableau calculi for certain                 Hybrid Logics. We prove that
            even though we increased                 the expressive power of XPath by introducing hybrid                 operators, the
            satisfiability problem for the obtained                 logic is still PSpace-complete.
