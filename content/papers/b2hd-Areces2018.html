         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Given a logic L, the L-Definability Problem for finite                 structures takes as input a finite structure A and
            a                 target relation T over the domain of A, and determines                 whether there is a formula of L whose
            interpretation in                 A coincides with T. In this note we present an                 algorithm that solves the
            definability problem for                 quantifier-free first order formulas. Our algorithm                 takes advantage
            of a semantic characterization of open                 definability via subisomorphisms, which is sound and              
              complete. We also provide an empirical evaluation of                 its performance.
