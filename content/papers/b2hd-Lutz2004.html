         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Many description logics (DLs) combine knowledge                 representation on an abstract, logical level with an     
            interface to 'concrete' domains like numbers and                 strings with built-in predicates such as &gt;, +, and      
            prefix-of. These hybrid DLs have turned out to be                 useful in several application areas, such as reasoning 
            about conceptual database models. We propose to further                 extend such DLs with key constraints that allow the
            expression of statements like 'US citizens are uniquely                 identified by their social security number'. Based
            on                 this idea, we introduce a number of natural description                 logics and perform a detailed analysis
            of their                 decidability and computational complexity. It turns out                 that naive extensions with
            key constraints easily lead                 to undecidability, whereas more careful extensions                 yield NExpTime-complete
            DLs for a variety of useful                 concrete domains.
