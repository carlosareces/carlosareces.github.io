         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">A notation to describe software system designs is                 given together with the means to verify properties over
            them. De- signs are considered as models of a modal                 logic. The pro- cedure to derive the modal model     
            associated to a design, the algorithm to check                 properties over a model, the method to de ne new          
                  relations and the method of model ltration are                 presented. The proposed logic (KPI a poly-modal logic
                            with inverse operators) is used as a property speci                 cation language veri ed through a model
            checking                 algorithm. The methods provided proved to be e ective                 and simple to im- plement.
            A prototype tool has been                 developed in SML-NJ covering all functionalities                 described.
