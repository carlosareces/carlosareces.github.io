         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We generalize the notion of symmetries of                 propositional formulas in conjunctive normal form to           
                 modal formulas. Our framework uses the coinductive                 models introduced in [4] and, hence, the results apply
                            to a wide class of modal logics including, for example,                 hybrid logics. Our main result shows
            that the                 symmetries of a modal formula preserve entailment: if                 \sigma is a symmetry of \phi
            then \phi |= \psi if and                 only if \phi |= \sigma(\psi).
