  abstract         = {Relation-changing modal logics are extensions of the basic modal logic
	that allow changes to the accessibility relation of a model during
	the evaluation of a formula. In particular, they are equipped with
	dynamic modalities that are able to delete, add, and swap edges in
	the model, both locally and globally. We provide translations from
	these logics to hybrid logic along with an implementation. In general,
	these logics are undecidable, but we use our translations to identify
	decidable fragments. We also compare the expressive power of relation-changing
	modal logics with hybrid logics.},
