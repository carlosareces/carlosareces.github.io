  abstract =     "Deontic logics are dubbed the logics of normative or
                 prescriptive reasoning. These logics can roughly be
                 categorized into ought-to-be, dealing with the
                 prescription of state of affairs, or ought-to-do,
                 dealing with the prescription of actions. An important
                 family of ought-to-do deontic logics have their origin
                 in Segerberg's Deontic Action Logic (DAL, see [23]). In
                 this work, we provide an algebraic characterization of
                 DAL and some known variants. In brief, we capture
                 actions and formulas as elements of dif- ferent base
                 algebras, and deontic operators as algebraic
                 operations; different algebras capture the different
                 variants. This algebraization enables us to obtain
                 complete- ness results via standard algebraic means.
                 Moreover, we argue that this algebraic framework offers
                 a natural way of (re-)thinking many deontic logical
                 issues at large.",
