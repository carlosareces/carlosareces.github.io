         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We study dynamic modal operators that can change                 themodel during the evaluation of a formula. In         
            particular, we extend thebasic modal language with                 diamond modalities that are able to swap, delete or add
                            pairs of related elements of the domain, while                 traversing an edge of the accessibility relation.
            We                 study these languages together with the sabotage modal                 logic, which can arbitrarily delete
            edges of the model.                 We define a suitable notion of bisimulation for the                 basic modal logic
            extended with each of the new dynamic                 operators and investigate their expressive power,                 showing
            that they are all uncomparable. We also show                 that the complexity of their model checking problems is     
                       PSpace- complete.
