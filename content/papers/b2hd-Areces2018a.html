         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Relation-changing modal logics are extensions of the                 basic modal logic with dynamic operators that modify
            the accessibility relation of a model during the                 evaluation of a formula. These languages are equipped   
            with dynamic modalities that are able, for example, to                 delete, add, and swap edges in the model, both locally
            and globally. We study the satisfiability problem for                 some of these logics. We first show that they can be
                            translated into hybrid logic. As a result, we can                 transfer some results from hybrid logics
            to                 elation-changing modal logics. We discuss in                 particular, decidability for some fragments.
            We then                 show that satisfiability is, in general, undecidable                 for all the languages introduced,
            via translations from                 memory logics.
