         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">In this paper we discuss the implementation of a                 hybrid logic theorem prover based on resolution,        
                    HyLoRes, which fuses first-order proving techniques                 with modal and hybrid reasoning. The focus is
            on                 implementation details, and on how we adapted                 first-order methods to the hybrid environment.
