  abstract =     "The introduction of unary connectives has proved to be
                 an important addition to the categorial vocabulary. The
                 connectives considered so far are order-preserving; in
                 this paper instead, we consider the addition of
                 order-reversing, Galois connected operators. In ยง2 we
                 do the basic model-theoretic and proof-theoretic
                 groundwork. In ยง3 we use the expressive power of the
                 Galois connected operators to restrict the scopal
                 possibilities of generalized quantifier expressions,
                 and to describe a typology of polarity items.",
