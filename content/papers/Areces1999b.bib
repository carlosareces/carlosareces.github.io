  abstract =     "Hybrid languages are extended modal languages which
                 can refer to (or even quantify over) states. Such
                 languages are better behaved proof theoretically than
                 ordinary modal languages for they internalize the
                 apparatus of labeled deduction. Moreover, they arise
                 naturally in a variety of applications, including
                 description logic and temporal reason- ing. Thus it
                 would be useful to have a map of their
                 complexity-theoretic properties, and this paper
                 provides one. Our work falls into two parts. We first
                 examine the basic hybrid lan- guage and its multi-modal
                 and tense logical cousins. We show that the basic
                 hybrid language (and indeed, multi-modal hybrid
                 languages) are no more complex than ordinary uni-modal
                 logic: all have pspace-complete K-satisfiability
                 problems. We then show that adding even one nominal to
                 tense logic raises complexity from pspace to exptime.
                 In the second part we turn to stronger hybrid languages
                 in which it is possible to bind nom- inals. We prove a
                 general expressivity result showing that even the weak
                 form of binding offered by the \downarrow operator
                 easily leads to undecidability.",
