         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">In this article we present a modal logic that extends                 the basic modal logic ML with two dynamic operators:
            copy (cp), which replicates the current model,                 labelling each copy with a different propositional        
               symbol and respecting accessibility relations even                 between distinct copies; and remove (rm), which deletes
                            paths in the model that satify certain intermediate                 conditions. We call the resulting logic
            ML(cp, rm). We                 study its computational complexity, and its relative                 expressivity with respect
            to (static) modal logics ML                 and ML(&acirc;&#136;&#146;), and the dynamic epistemic Action Model                 Logic, AML.
