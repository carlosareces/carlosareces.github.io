         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We introduce a new semantics for a multi-agent                 epistemic operator of knowing how, based on an            
                indistinguishability relation between plans. Our                 proposal is, arguably, closer to the standard       
                     presentation of knowing that modalities in classical                 epistemic logic. We study the relationship between
            this                 semantics and previous approaches, showing that our                 setting is general enough to capture
            them. We also                 define a sound and complete axiomatization, and                 investigate the computational
            complexity of its model                 checking and satisfiability problems.
