         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We provide two different model theoretic                 characterizations of a fragment of first-order logic            
            which we call d-Horn formulas. This fragment is dual to                 the well known Horn fragment and has the same    
            complexity for proving unsatisfiability. The method                 used in the characterization (syntactic translation  
                          functions between formulas which are mimicked by                 translation functions between models) might
            be applied                 to characterize other first-order restrictions. This                 paper is related to the work
            of Henschen and Wos                 \shortcitehens:unit74, but we study semantic                 translation together with
            syntactic renaming functions.                 We comment shortly on a number of applications of                 d-Horn formulas,
            one of which is the characterization                 of Context Free Grammars through a Horn $\cup$ d-Horn               
             first-order theory.
