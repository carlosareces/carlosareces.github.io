         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">In this paper we show how permutation of literals can                 be used to define symmetries for modal formulas in 
            clausal form. We show that the symmetries of a modal                 formula $\varphi$ preserve inference: if $\sigma$ is
            a                 symmetry of $\varphi$ then $\varphi \models \psi$ if                 and only if $\varphi \models \sigma(\psi)$.
            Hence, a                 modal theorem prover that has access to the symmetries                 of the input formula, can
            use them during search to                 cheaply derive symmetric inferences (e.g., as is done                 during clause
            learning in propositional SAT). We also                 present in a mechanism to efficiently compute                 symmetries
            using graphs automorphisms, and preliminary                 empirical results showing that symmetries appear in          
                  many cases in both randomly generated and hand-tailored                 modal formulas.
