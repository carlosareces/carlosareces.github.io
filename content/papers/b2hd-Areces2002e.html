         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">While the complexity of concept satisfiability in both                 ALCO, the basic descrip- tion logic ALC enriched with
            nominals, and ALC(D), the extension of ALC with                 concrete domains, is known to be PSpace-complete, in     
                       this article we show that the combination ALCO(D) of                 these two logics can have a NExpTime-hard
            concept                 satisfiability problem (depending on the concrete                 domain D used). The proof is by
            a reduction of a                 NExpTime-complete variant of the domino problem to                 ALCO(D)- concept satisfiability.
