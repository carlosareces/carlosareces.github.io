         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Memory logics are modal logics whose semantics is                 specified in terms of relational models enriched with  
            additional data structure to represent memory. The                 logical language is then extended with a collection of
            operations to access and modify the data structure. In                 this paper we study their satisfiability and the model
            checking problems. We first give sound and complete                 tableaux calculi for the memory logic &icirc;&#136;&sup1;&icirc;&#136;&cedil; (k, r, e)
            (the basic modal language extended with the operator r                 used to memorize a state, the operator e used to wipe
                          out the memory, and the operator k used to check if the                 current point of evaluation is memorized)
            and some of                 its sublanguages. As the satisfiability problem of                 &icirc;&#136;&sup1;&icirc;&#136;&cedil; (k, r, e) is undecidable,
            the tableau calculus                 we present is non terminating. Hence, we furthermore                 study a variation
            that ensures termination, at the                 expense of completeness, and we use model checking to                 ensure
            soundness. Secondly, we show that the model                 checking problem is PSpace-complete.
