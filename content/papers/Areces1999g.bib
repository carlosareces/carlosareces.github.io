  abstract =     "We provide a resolution-based proof procedure for
                 modal and description logics that improves on previous
                 proposals in a number of important ways. First, it
                 avoids translations into large undecidable log- ics,
                 and works directly on modal or description logic
                 formulas instead. Second, by using labeled formulas it
                 avoids the complexities of earlier propositional
                 resolution-based methods for modal logic. Third, it
                 pro- vides a method for manipulating so-called
                 assertional information in the description logic
                 setting. And fourth, we believe that it combines ideas
                 from the method of prefixes used in tableaux and
                 resolution in such a way that some of the heuristics
                 and optimizations devised in either field are
                 applicable.",
