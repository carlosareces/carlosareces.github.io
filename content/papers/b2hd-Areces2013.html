         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">The QF UF category of the SMT-LIB test set contains many formulas	with symmetries, and breaking these symmetries results in
            an important	speedup [8]. We here propose SyMT, a simple tool based on graph automorphism	detection algorithms to find out
            symmetries in SMT formulas. SyMT	helps SMT users by highlighting the symmetries in theirformulas,	giving thus hints on how
            they can improve them to enforce the SMT	solver to examine one path out of many symmetric ones in the search	tree. The classic
            propositional symmetry breaking technique can be	lifted to SMT and yield a generic technique to break the symmetries	found
            by SyMT.	Experiments on a large part of the SMT-LIB show that symmetries are	pervasive in most categories.
