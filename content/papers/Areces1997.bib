  abstract =     "A notation to describe software system designs is
                 given together with the means to verify properties over
                 them. Design graphs are considered as models of an
                 extended modal logic. The procedure to derive the modal
                 model associated with a design, the algorithm to check
                 properties over a model, the method to define new
                 relations and the method fo model fitration are
                 presented. These methods are introduced using the
                 classic example of KWIC (Key Word in Context) and
                 further tested on two different design systems to show
                 their usefulness and generality. The logic proposed is
                 called KPI (a poly-modal logic with inverse operators)
                 and will be used as a property specification language
                 verified through an algorithm of model checking. The
                 methods proposed are effective and simple to
                 implement.",
