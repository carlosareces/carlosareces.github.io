         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Due to the concatenative interpretation of its composition operator,	the base categorial type logic \NLd encounters some difficulties	when
            analyzing non-concatenative material. Hence, modeling linguistic	phenomena like anaphora resolution, long distance binding,
            gapping,	discontinuity and quantifier raising becomes a problem in this logic.	We propose an extension of \NLd with hybrid
            operators (nominals and	the \,:-operator), and show that this extension has the needed expressivity	to define frame classes
            leading to a proper modeling of long distance	binding. We focus our presentation on the treatment of quantifier	phrases.
