  abstract         = {Current classical planners are very successful in finding (nonoptimal) plans, even for large planning instances. To do so, most planners rely on a preprocessing stage that computes a grounded representation of the task. Whenever the grounded task is too big to be generated (i.e., whenever this preprocess fails) the instance cannot even be tackled by the actual planner. To address this issue, we introduce a partial grounding approach that grounds only a projection of the task, when complete grounding is not feasible. We propose a guiding mechanism that, for a given domain, identifies the parts of a task that are relevant to find a plan by using off-the-shelf machine learning methods. Our empirical evaluation attests that the approach is capable of solving planning instances that are too big to be fully grounded.},
