         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We present three different techniques that use information about symmetries	detected in the input formula to block the expansion
            of diamonds	in a modal tableau. We show how these blocking techniques can be	included in a standard tableaux calculus for
            the basic modal logic,	and prove that they preserve soundness and completeness. We empirically	evaluate these blocking mechanisms
            in different modal benchmarks.
