  abstract =     "Relation-changing modal logics are extensions of the
                 basic modal logic that allow to change the
                 accessibility relation of a model during the evaluation
                 of a formula. In particular, they are equipped with
                 dynamic modalities that are able to delete, add and
                 swap edges in the model, both locally and globally. We
                 investigate the satisfiability problem of these logics.
                 We define satisfiability-preserving translations from
                 an undecidable memory logic to relation-changing modal
                 logics. This way we show that their satisfiability
                 problems are undecidable.",
