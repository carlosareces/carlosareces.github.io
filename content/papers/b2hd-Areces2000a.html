         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Since they were introduced, AGM revision and Katsuno                 and Mendelzon's update have been considered esentially
            different theory change operations serving different                 purposes. This work provides a new presentation of AGM
            revision based on the update semantic apparatus                 establishing in such a way a bridge between the two      
            seemingly incomparable frameworks. We define a new                 operation $\bar\bullet$ as a variant of the standard  
            update $\bullet$ that we call an analytic revision. We                 prove the correspondence between analytic revisions
            and                 (transitively relational) AGM revisions when a given                 fixed theory is considered (Theorem
            4.8). Furthermore,                 we can characterize analytic revision functions for                 possibly infinite languages
            as those AGM revisions                 satisfying (K*1)-(K*8) plus two new postulates                 (LU-$\exists$) and (LU-$\forall$)
            governing the                 revision of different theories (Theorem 5.3). We                 believe these results bring
            new light to the issue of                 how revision and update functions are related. They                 also provide
            a novel way to achieve iterated theory                 revision.
