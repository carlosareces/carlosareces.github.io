         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We provide a set of postulates that characterizes                 Katsuno and Mendelzon&acirc;&#128;&#153;s update operation [3] for a   
            possibly infinite propositional language. In this way                 we extend their original operator which was only   
            defined for finite languages. After reformulating the                 update operation as a function on theories, we show
            that Katsuno and Mendelzon&acirc;&#128;&#153;s original postulates are                 not sufficient to provide a characterization theorem.
            A                 strengthening of postulate (U8) is needed for a                 representation result. The new definition
            of update on                 (possibly infinite) languages puts the two main notions                 of theory change (update
            and revision) in the same                 ground and opens the way to a better comparison of                 their prop- erties.
