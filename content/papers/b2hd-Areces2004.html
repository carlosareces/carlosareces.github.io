         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Even though residuation is at the core of Categorial                 Grammar (Lambek, 1958), it is not always immediate to
            realize how standard logical systems like Multi-modal                 Categorial Type Logics (MCTL) (Moortgat, 1997) actually
            embody this property. In this paper, we focus on the                 basic system NL (Lambek, 1961) and its extension with
            unary modalities NL(3) (Moortgat, 1996), and we spell                 things out by means of Display Calculi (DC) (Belnap,
            1982; Gor&Atilde;&copy;, 1998). The use of structural operators in                 DC permits a sharp distinction between the core   
            properties we want to impose on the logical system and                 the way these properties are projected into the logical
            operators. We will show how we can obtain Lambek                 residuated triple \, / and &acirc;&#128;&cent; of binary operators, and 
            how the operators 3 and 2&acirc;&#134;&#147; introduced by Moortgat in                 (Moortgat, 1996) are indeed their unary counterpart.
            In                 the second part of the paper we turn to other important                 algebraic properties which are
            usually investigated in                 conjunction with residuation (Birkhoff, 1967): Galois                 and dual Galois
            connections. Again, DC let us readily                 define logical calculi capturing them. We also provide             
               preliminary ideas on how to use these new operators                 when modeling linguistic phenomena.
