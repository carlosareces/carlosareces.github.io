  abstract =     "We investigate interpolation and Beth definability in
                 default logics. To this end, we start by defining a
                 general framework which is sufficiently abstract to
                 encompass most of the usual definitions of a default
                 Logic. In this framework a default logic DL is built on
                 a base, monotonic, logic L. We then investigate the
                 question of when interpolation and Beth definability
                 results transfer from L to DL. This investigation needs
                 suitable notions of interpolation and Beth definability
                 for default logics. We show both positive and negative
                 general results: depending on how DL is defined and of
                 the kind of interpolation/Beth definability involved,
                 the property might or might not transfer from L to
                 DL.",
