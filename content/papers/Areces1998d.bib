  abstract =     "We consider two recently proposed defini- tions of the
                 expressive power of description logics, one due to
                 Baader, the other due to Kurtonina and de Rijke. The
                 proposals are non-equivalent, and we explain their
                 differences, similarities, as well as ways in which
                 they are related. We also map out a research agenda
                 resulting from efforts to combine the two approaches.",
