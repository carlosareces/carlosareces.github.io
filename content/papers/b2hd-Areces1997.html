         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">A notation to describe software system designs is                 given together with the means to verify properties over
            them. Design graphs are considered as models of an                 extended modal logic. The procedure to derive the modal
            model associated with a design, the algorithm to check                 properties over a model, the method to define new 
            relations and the method fo model fitration are                 presented. These methods are introduced using the        
            classic example of KWIC (Key Word in Context) and                 further tested on two different design systems to show 
                           their usefulness and generality. The logic proposed is                 called KPI (a poly-modal logic with
            inverse operators)                 and will be used as a property specification language                 verified through
            an algorithm of model checking. The                 methods proposed are effective and simple to                 implement.
