  abstract         = {This paper sings a song -- a song created by bringing together the
	work of four great names in the history of logic: Hans Reichenbach,
	Arthur Prior, Richard Montague, and Leon Henkin. Although the work
	of the first three of these authors have previously been combined,
	adding the ideas of Leon Henkin is the addition required to make
	the combination work at the logical level. But the present paper
	does not focus on the underlying technicalities (these can be found
	in Areces, Blackburn, Huertas, and Manzano [to appear]) rather it
	focusses on the underlying instruments, and the way they work together.
	We hope the reader will be tempted to sing along.},
