         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Memory logics are a family of modal logics in which                 standard relational structures are augmented with data
                            structures and additional operations to modify and                 query these structures. In this paper we
            present sound                 and complete axiomatizations for some members of this                 family. We analyze the
            use of nominals to achieve                 completeness, and present one example in which they can                 be avoided.
