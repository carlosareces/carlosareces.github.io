  abstract =     "We consider description logic knowledge bases in which
                 the ABox can contain Boolean combinations of
                 traditional ABox assertions (represented as clauses or
                 sequents). A linear reduction of such knowledge bases
                 into a standard format (al- lowing only conjunctive
                 assertions) is described which preserves knowledge base
                 satisfiability. Similar results are presented for
                 Boolean TBoxes and Boolean com- binations of both ABox
                 and TBox statements.",
