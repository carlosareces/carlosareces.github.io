         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Quantified hybrid logic is quantified modal logic                 extended with apparatus for nam- ing states and        
            asserting that a formula is true at a named state.                 While interpolation and Beth&acirc;&#128;&#153;s definability theorem 
            fail in a number of well known quantified modal logics                 (for example in quantified modal K, T, D, S4, S4.3
            and                 S5 with constant domains), their counterparts in                 quantified hybrid logic have these properties.
            These                 are special cases of the main result of the paper: the                 quantified hybrid logic of any
            class of frames                 definable in the bounded fragment of first-order logic                 has the interpo- lation
            property, irrespective of                 whether varying, constant, expanding, or contracting                 domains are
            assumed.
