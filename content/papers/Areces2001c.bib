  abstract =     "The introdu tion of unary onne tives has proved to be
                 an important addition to the ategorial vo abulary. The
                 onne tives onsidered so far are order-preserving; in
                 this paper instead, we onsider the addition of
                 order-reversing, Galois onne ted operators. In x2 we do
                 the basi model-theoreti and proof-theoreti groundwork.
                 In x3 we use the expressive power of the Galois onne
                 ted operators to restri t the s opal possibilities of
                 generalized quanti er expressions, and to des ribe a
                 typology of polarity items.",
