  abstract         = {We present a technique that is able to detect symmetries in formulas
	of the basic modal logic (BML). Then we introduce a modal tableaux
	calculus for BML with a blocking mechanism that takes advantage of
	symmetry information about the input formula to restrict the application
	of the ($\Diamond$) rule. We prove completeness of the calculus.
	Finally, we empirically evaluate both, the detection technique and
	the blocking mechanism in different modal benchmarks.},
