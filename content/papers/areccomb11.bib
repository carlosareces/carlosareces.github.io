  abstract         = {Combination of decision procedures is at the heart of Satisfiability
	Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers. It provides ways to compose decision
	procedures for expressive languages which mix symbols from various
	decidable theories. Typical combinations include (linear) arithmetic,
	uninterpreted symbols, arrays operators, etc. In [7] we showed that
	any first-order theory from the Bernays-Schonfinkel-Ramsey fragment,
	the two variable fragment, or the monadic fragment can be combined
	with virtually any other decidable theory. Here, we complete the
	picture by considering the Ackermann fragment, and several guarded
	fragments. All theories in these fragments can be combined with other
	decidable (combinations of) theories, with only minor restrictions.
	In particular, it is not required for these other theories to be
	stably-infinite.},
