         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Hybrid logics are extensions of orthodox modal logics                 in which it is possible to name worlds (or states, or
            times, ...). Such extensions have proved interesting                 for a number of reasons. We often want to reason about
            what happens at particular states, times, or locations,                 and this isn&acirc;&#128;&#153;t possible in orthodox modal logics.
            In                 addition, hybridization can improve the behavior of the                 underlying modal logic. For example,
            many modally                 undefinable properties (such as irreflexivity) are                 definable in hybrid logic,
            and general completeness and                 interpolation results can be obtained. Previous work                 has examined
            the effects of hybridizing propositional                 modal logics. But what happens when a first-order modal         
            logic is hybridized? First-order modal logics are often                 badly behaved &acirc;&#128;&#148; does hybridization improve the 
            situation? As far as interpolation is concerned, yes.                 As we shall see, hybridization allows us to repair 
            failures of interpolation in first-order modal logic,                 in a very general way. This abstract is not self   
            contained. For first-order modal logic (and in                 particular, a discussion of varying, expanding,           
            contracting, and constant domains), see Fitting and                 Mendelsohn [4]. For Beth definability and Craig      
            iterpolation, see Chang and Keisler [2]. As for hybrid                 logic, the most relevant points are the following.
            Hybrid logic contains special variables, written w, w0                 , . . . , which range over worlds. Prefixing a formula
                            by &acirc;&#134;&#147;w binds the variable w to the world of                 evaluation, while prefixing a formula by @w means
            that                 the formula should be evaluated at the state named by                 w. As the examples below show,
            it is the interplay                 between &acirc;&#134;&#147;w (&acirc;&#128;&#156;let w name the current state&acirc;&#128;&#157;) and                 @w (&acirc;&#128;&#156;evaluate
            at the state named by w&acirc;&#128;&#157;) that enable                 us to create interpolants so easily. For a detailed              
              examination of \downarrow and @ in the propositional                 case, see Areces, Blackburn and Marx [1].
