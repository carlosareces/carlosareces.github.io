  abstract         = {Memory logics are a family of modal logics in which standard relational
	structures are augmented with data structures and additional operations
	to modify and query these structures. In this paper we present sound
	and complete axiomatizations for some members of this family. We
	analyze the use of nominals to achieve completeness, and present
	one example in which they can be avoided.},
