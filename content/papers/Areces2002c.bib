  abstract =     "In recent years, an important number of theoretical
                 results concerning axiomatizability, proof systems
                 (e.g., tableaux, natural deduction), interpolation,
                 expressive power, complexity, etc. for hybrid logics
                 have been obtained. The next natural step is to develop
                 provers that can handle these languages. HyLoRes is a
                 direct resolution prover for hybrid logics implementing
                 a sound and complete algorithm for satisfiability of
                 sentences in H(@,\downarrow).",
