  abstract =     "We provide a set of postulates that characterizes
                 Katsuno and Mendelzon’s update operation [3] for a
                 possibly infinite propositional language. In this way
                 we extend their original operator which was only
                 defined for finite languages. After reformulating the
                 update operation as a function on theories, we show
                 that Katsuno and Mendelzon’s original postulates are
                 not sufficient to provide a characterization theorem. A
                 strengthening of postulate (U8) is needed for a
                 representation result. The new definition of update on
                 (possibly infinite) languages puts the two main notions
                 of theory change (update and revision) in the same
                 ground and opens the way to a better comparison of
                 their prop- erties.",
