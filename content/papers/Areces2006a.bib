  abstract =     "Hybrid languages are modal languages that have special
                 symbols for naming individual states in models. Their
                 history can be traced back to work of Arthur Prior in
                 the fifties. The subject has recently regained
                 interest, resulting in many new results and techniques.
                 This chapter contains a modern overview of the field.
                 We sketch its history, and survey the basic properties
                 of various hybrid languages, focussing on model theory
                 (completeness, expressivity, definability,
                 interpolation), decidability and complexity, and proof
                 theory. We also discuss a number of connections with
                 other fields.",
