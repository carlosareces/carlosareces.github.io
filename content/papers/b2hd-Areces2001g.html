         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We describe a new relational translation of modal                 formulas into first-order formulas. The key idea       
            underlying the improvement is to encode a very strong                 form of the tree model property in the translation.
            Using our tree- based heuristics, we have consistently                 seen improvements, both in terms of the number of 
                           clauses generated and in terms of CPU time used. Our                 ongoing work is aimed at exploring the
            behavior of our                 heuristics in larger parts of the problem space, and at                 encoding weaker forms
            of the tree model property to                 boost the performance of resolution provers on input                 from different
            modal logics, such as K4, S4, and                 temporal logic.
