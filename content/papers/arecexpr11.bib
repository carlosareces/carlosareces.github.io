  abstract         = {We investigate the expressive power of memory logics. These are modal
	logics extended with the possibility to store (or remove) the current
	node of evaluation in (or from) a memory, and to perform membership
	tests on the current memory. From this perspective, the hybrid logic
	HL(\downarrow), for example, can be thought of as a particular case
	of a memory logic where the memory is an indexed list of elements
	of the domain.
	This work focuses in the case where the memory is a set, and we can
	test whether the current node belongs to the set or not. We prove
	that, in terms of expressive power, the memory logics we discuss
	here lie between the basic modal logic and HL(\downarrow). We show
	that the satisfiability problem of most of the logics we cover is
	undecidable. The only logic with a decidable satisfiability problem
	is obtained by imposing strong constraints on which elements can
	be memorized.},
