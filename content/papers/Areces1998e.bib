                 Since-Until logics we define an adequate notion of
                 bisimulation and establish general theorems concerning
                 the interpolation property. using these general results
                 we prove tha tthe basic SU-logic and any SU-logic whose
                 class of frames can be defined by universal Horn
                 formulas have interpolation. In particular, the
                 SU-logic of branching time has interpolation, while
                 linear time fails to have this property.",
