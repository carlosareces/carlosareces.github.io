         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We present three different techniques that use                 information about symmetries detected in the input        
            formula to block the expansion of diamonds in a modal                 tableau. We show how these blocking techniques can be
                            included in a standard tableaux calculus for the basic                 modal logic, and prove that they preserve
            soundness and                 completeness. We empirically evaluate these blocking                 mechanisms in different
            modal benchmarks.
