  abstract         = {Since they were introduced, AGM revision and Katsuno and Mendelzon's
	update have been considered esentially different theory change operations
	serving different purposes. This work provides a new presentation
	of AGM revision based on the update semantic apparatus
	establishing in such a way a bridge between the two seemingly incomparable
	frameworks.
	We define a new operation $\bar{\bullet}$ as a variant of the standard
	update $\bullet$ that we call an analytic revision. We prove the
	correspondence between
	analytic revisions and (transitively relational) AGM revisions when
	a given fixed theory is considered (Theorem 4.8). Furthermore, we
	can characterize analytic revision functions for possibly infinite
	languages as those AGM revisions satisfying (K*1)-(K*8) plus two
	new postulates (LU-$\exists$) and (LU-$\forall$) governing the revision
	of different theories (Theorem 5.3).
	We believe these results bring new light to the issue of how revision
	and update functions are related. They also provide a novel way to
	achieve iterated theory revision.},
