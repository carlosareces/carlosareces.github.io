         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We investigate dynamic operations acting over a                 knowing how logic. Our approach makes use of a recently  
            introduced semantics for the knowing how operator,                 based on an indistinguishability relation between     
            plans. This semantics is arguably closer to the                 standard presentation of knowing that modalities in      
                      classic epistemic logic. Here, we discuss how the                 semantics enables us to define dynamic modalities
                            representing different ways in which an agent can learn                 how to achieve a goal. In this regard,
            we study two                 types of updates: ontic updates (for which we provide                 axiomatizations over a
            particular class of models), and                 epistemic updates (for which we investigate some                 semantic
            properties).
