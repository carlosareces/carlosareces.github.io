  abstract         = {We study dynamic modal operators that can change the accessibility
	relation of a model during the evaluation of a formula. In particular,
	we extend the basic modal language with modalities that are able
	to delete, add or swap an edge between pairs of elements of the domain.
	We define a generic framework to characterize this kind of operations.
	First, we investigate relation-changing modal logics as fragments
	of classical logics. Then, we use the new framework to get a suitable
	notion of bisimulation for the logics introduced, and we investigate
	their expressive power. Finally, we show that the complexity of the
	model checking problem for the particular operators introduced is
	PSpace-complete, and we study two subproblems of model checking:
	formula complexity and program complexity.},
