         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We study dynamic modal operators that can change the accessibility	relation of a model during the evaluation of a formula.
            In particular,	we extend the basic modal language with modalities that are able	to delete, add or swap an edge between pairs
            of elements of the domain.	We define a generic framework to characterize this kind of operations.	First, we investigate relation-changing
            modal logics as fragments	of classical logics. Then, we use the new framework to get a suitable	notion of bisimulation for
            the logics introduced, and we investigate	their expressive power. Finally, we show that the complexity of the	model checking
            problem for the particular operators introduced is	PSpace-complete, and we study two subproblems of model checking:	formula
            complexity and program complexity.
