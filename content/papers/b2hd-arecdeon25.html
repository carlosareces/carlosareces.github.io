         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">In a seminal work, K. Segerberg introduced deontic action logic (DAL) as a formalframework to investigate normative reasoning
            over actions. In this work, we re-visit DAL and provide a complete algebraization for it. To this end, we introducedeontic
            action algebras&acirc;&#128;&#148;algebraic structures consisting of a Boolean algebra forinterpreting actions, a Boolean algebra for interpreting
            formulas, and two map-pings from one Boolean algebra to the other interpreting the deontic concepts ofpermission and prohibition.
            We show how this framework supports the derivationof various deontic action logics by imposing or relaxing structural conditions
            oneither Boolean algebra. This flexibility allows us to uniformly account for severallogics within the broader DAL family.
            In particular, we introduce four variationsobtained by: (a) enriching the algebra of formulas with propositions on states,
            (b)adopting a Heyting algebra for state propositions, (c) adopting a Heyting algebrafor actions, and (d) adopting Heyting
            algebras for both. We illustrate these newdeontic action logics with examples and establish their algebraic completeness.
