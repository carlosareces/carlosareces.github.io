                 domains introduced by Baader and Hanschke, we provide a
                 system which is aimed at enhancing image retrieval with
                 the ability to perform spatial reasoning. In this early
                 stage of our research we focus on obtaining a formalism
                 which is expressive enough to increase the usefulness
                 of expensive pictur description (commin in content
                 based image retrieval systems) by means ofj89 spatial
