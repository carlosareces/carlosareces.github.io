         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Many description logics (DLs) combine knowledge representation on	an abstract, logical level with an interface to `concrete''
            domains	such as numbers and strings with built-in predicates such as &lt;, +,	and prefix-of. These hybrid DLs have turned out
            to be useful for	reasoning about conceptual models of information systems, and as	the basis for expressive ontology languages.
            We propose to further	extend such DLs with key constraints that allow the expression of	statements like `US citizens are uniquely
            identified by their social	security number''. Based on this idea, we introduce a number of natural	description logics and
            perform a detailed analyses of their decidability	and computational complexity. It turns out that naive extensions	with key
            constraints easily lead to undecidability, whereas more	careful extensions yield NExpTime-complete DLs for a variety of useful	concrete
            domains.
