         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Data-aware modal logics offer a powerful formalism for                  reasoning about semi-structured queries in languages
            such as DataGL, XPath, and GQL. In brief, these                  logics can be viewed as modal systems capable of        
            expressing both reachability statements and                  data-aware properties, such as value                  comparisons.
            One particularly expressive logic in                  this landscape is HXPathD, a hybrid modal logic that               
            captures not only the navigational core of XPath but                  also data comparisons, node labels (keys), and     
            key-based navigation operators. While previous work                  on HXPathD has primarily focused on its             
            model-theoretic properties, in this paper we                  approach HXPathD from a proof-theoretic perspective.       
            Concretely, we present a sound and complete                  Gentzen-style sequent calculus for                  HXPathD.
            Moreover, we show all rules in this                  calculus are invertible, and that it enjoys cut                  elimination.
            Our work contributes to the                  proof-theoretic foundations of data-aware modal                  logics, and
            enables a deeper logical analysis of                  query languages over graph-structured                  data. Moreover,
            our results lay the groundwork for                  extending proof-theoretic techniques to a broader                  class
            of modal systems.
