  abstract = {Memory logics is a family of modal logics whose semantics is specified
	in terms of relational models enriched with additional data structure
	to represent a memory. The logical language includes a collection
	of operations to access and modify the data structure. In this paper
	we study basic model properties of memory logics, and prove results
	concerning characterization, definability and interpolation. While
	the first two properties hold for all memory logics introduced in
	this article, interpolation fails in most cases.},
