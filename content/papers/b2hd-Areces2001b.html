         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">The introduction of unary connectives has proved to be                 an important addition to the categorial vocabulary.
            The                 connectives considered so far are order-preserving; in                 this paper instead, we consider
            the addition of                 order-reversing, Galois connected operators. In &Acirc;&sect;2 we                 do the basic model-theoretic
            and proof-theoretic                 groundwork. In &Acirc;&sect;3 we use the expressive power of the                 Galois connected
            operators to restrict the scopal                 possibilities of generalized quantifier expressions,                 and
            to describe a typology of polarity items.
