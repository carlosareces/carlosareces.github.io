  abstract =     "In this article we formally define and investigate the
                 computational complexity of the Definability Problem
                 for open first-order formulas (i.e., quantifier free
                 first-order formulas) with equality. Given a logic L,
                 the L-Definability Problem for finite structures takes
                 as input a finite structure A and a target relation T
                 over the domain of A, and determines whether there is a
                 formula of L whose interpretation in A coincides with T
                 . We show that the complexity of this problem for open
                 first-order formulas (open definability, for short) is
                 coNP- complete. We also investigate the parametric
                 complexity of the prob- lem, and prove that if the size
                 and the arity of the target relation T are taken as
                 parameters then open definability is coW[1]-complete
                 for every vocabulary Ï„ with at least one, at least
                 binary, relation.",
