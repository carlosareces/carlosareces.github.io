  abstract =     "Often, we assume that an action is permitted simply
                 because it is not explicitly forbidden; or, similarly,
                 that an action is forbidden simply because it is not
                 explicitly permitted. This kind of assumptions appear,
                 e.g., in autonomous computing systems where decisions
                 must be taken in the presence of an incomplete set of
                 norms regulating a particular scenario. Combining
                 default and deontic reasoning over actions allows us to
                 formally reason about such assumptions. With this in
                 mind, we propose a logical formalism for default
                 reasoning over a deontic action logic. The novelty of
                 our approach is twofold. First, our formalism for
                 default reasoning deals with actions and action
                 operators, and it is based on the deontic action logic
                 originally proposed by Segerberg in [27]. Second,
                 inspired by Segerberg's approach, we use tools coming
                 from the theory of Boolean Algebra. These tools allow
                 us to extend Segerberg's algebraic completeness result
                 to the setting of Default Logics.",
