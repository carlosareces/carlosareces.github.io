         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We investigate model theoretic properties of XPath                 with data (in)equality tests over the class of data   
            trees, i.e., the class of trees where each node                 contains a label from a finite alphabet and a data       
            value from an infinite domain. We provide notions of                 (bi)simulations for XPath logics containing the child,
            parent, ancestor and descendant axes to navigate the                 tree. We show that these notions pre- cisely        
            characterize the equivalence relation associated with                 each logic. We study formula complexity measures   
            consisting of the number of nested axes and nested                 subformulas in a formula; these notions are akin to the
            notion of quantifier rank in first-order logic. We show                 characterization results for fine grained notions
            of                 equivalence and (bi)simulation that take into account                 these complexity measures. We also
            prove that positive                 fragments of these logics correspond to the formulas                 preserved under (non-symmetric)
            simulations. We show                 that the logic including the child axis is equivalent                 to the fragment
            of first-order logic invariant under                 the corresponding notion of bisimulation. If upward                 navigation
            is allowed the characterization fails but a                 weaker result can still be established. These results        
                    hold both over the class of possibly infinite data                 trees and over the class of finite data trees.
            Besides                 their intrinsic theoretical value, we argue that                 bisimulations are useful tools to
            prove                 (non)expressivity results for the logics studied here,                 and we substantiate this claim
            with examples.
