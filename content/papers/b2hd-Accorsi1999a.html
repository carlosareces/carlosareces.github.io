         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">In this paper we report on ongoing work on using a                 constraint-based approach towards feature interaction.
            From a logic specification of the Basic Call Service                 (BCS), we derive a labelled transition system       
            representing this service. This graphical                 interpretation is implemented in smodels and tested for        
            a variety of properties. We have devised a stepwise                 methodology for integrating features. According to our
            method, features act as constraints on models of the                 original basic system. On the one hand they forbid some
                            of the original behaviour of the system (thus pruning                 some models), and on the other they
            give rise to new                 models, representing new behaviour. Using this                 methodology, we have implemented
            a small number of                 features on top of the basic call service, and we                 report on some of the
            tests that we have performed.
