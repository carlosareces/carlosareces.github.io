         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">In their simplest form, hybrid languages are                 propositional modal languages which can refer to            
            states. They were introduced by Arthur Prior, the                 inventor of tense logic, and played an important role  
            in his work: because they make reference to specific                 times possible, they remove the most serious obstacle
            to developing modal approaches to temporal                 representation and reasoning. However very little is          
            known about the computational complexity of hybrid                 temporal logics. In this paper we analyze the         
            complexity of the satisfiability problem of a number of                 hybrid temporal logics: the basic hybrid language
            over                 transitive frames; nominal tense logic over transitive                 frames, strict total orders, and
            transitive trees;                 nominal Until logic; and referential interval logic. We                 discuss the effects
            of including nominals, the @                 operator, the somewhere modality E, and the difference                 operator
            D. Adding nominals to tense logic leads for                 several frame&acirc;&#128;&#147;classes to an increase in complexity of      
            the satisfiability problem from pspace to exptime. On                 transitive trees, however, the satisfiability problem
            for this language can be decided in pspace. Along the                 way we make a detour through hybrid propositional  
                          dynamic logic: we establish upper bounds for a number                 of temporal logics by generalizing results
            due to Passy                 and Tinchev [PT91] and De Giacomo [De 95]. We conclude                 with some remarks on the
            relevance of our results to                 description logic, and draw attention to the utility of                 the spypoint
            technique for proving upper and lower                 bounds.
