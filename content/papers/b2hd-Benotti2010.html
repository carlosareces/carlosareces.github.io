         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We present an on-going research project carried out at the Universidad	Nacional de Cordoba in Argentina. This project investigates
            theoretical	and practical research questions related to the development of a	dialogue system situated in a virtual environment.
            We describe the	PLN research group in which this project is being developed and,	in particular, we spell out the areas of
            expertise of the authors.	Moreover, we discuss relevant past, current and future collaborations	of the research group.
