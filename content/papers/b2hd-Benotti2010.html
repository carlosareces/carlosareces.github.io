         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We present an on-going research project carried out at                 the Universidad Nacional de Cordoba in Argentina. This
                            project investigates theoretical and practical research                 questions related to the development
            of a dialogue                 system situated in a virtual environment. We describe                 the PLN research group
            in which this project is being                 developed and, in particular, we spell out the areas of                 expertise
            of the authors. Moreover, we discuss relevant                 past, current and future collaborations of the research    
                        group.
