         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We provide a resolution-based proof procedure for                 modal and description logics that improves on previous 
            proposals in a number of important ways. First, it                 avoids translations into large undecidable log- ics,  
            and works directly on modal or description logic                 formulas instead. Second, by using labeled formulas it  
                          avoids the complexities of earlier propositional                 resolution-based methods for modal logic. Third,
            it                 pro- vides a method for manipulating so-called                 assertional information in the description
            logic                 setting. And fourth, we believe that it combines ideas                 from the method of prefixes used
            in tableaux and                 resolution in such a way that some of the heuristics                 and optimizations devised
            in either field are                 applicable.
