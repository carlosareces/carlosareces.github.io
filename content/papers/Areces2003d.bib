  abstract =     "We provide a detailed analysis of very weak fragments
                 of modal logic. Our fragments lack connectives that
                 introduce non- determinism and they feature
                 restrictions on the modal operators, which may lead to
                 substantial reductions in complexity. Our main result
                 is a general game-based characterization of the
                 expressive power of our fragments over the class of
                 finite structures.",
