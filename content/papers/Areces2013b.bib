  abstract         = {We generalize the notion of symmetries of propositional formulas in
	conjunctive normal form to modal formulas. Our framework uses the
	coinductive models introduced in [4] and, hence, the results apply
	to a wide class of modal logics including, for example, hybrid logics.
	Our main result shows that the symmetries of a modal formula preserve
	entailment: if $\sigma$ is a symmetry of $\varphi$ then $\varphi
	\models \psi$ if and only if $\varphi \models \sigma(\psi)$.},
