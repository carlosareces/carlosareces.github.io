  abstract =     "We generalize the notion of symmetries of
                 propositional formulas in conjunctive normal form to
                 modal formulas. Our framework uses the coinductive
                 models introduced in [4] and, hence, the results apply
                 to a wide class of modal logics including, for example,
                 hybrid logics. Our main result shows that the
                 symmetries of a modal formula preserve entailment: if
                 $\sigma$ is a symmetry of $\varphi$ then $\varphi
                 \models \psi$ if and only if $\varphi \models
                 \sigma(\psi)$.",
