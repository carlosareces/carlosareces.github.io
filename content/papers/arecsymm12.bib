  abstract = {We generalize the notion of symmetries of propositional formulas in
	conjunctive normal form to modal formulas. Our framework uses the
	coinductive models introduced in [4] and, hence, the results apply
	to a wide class of modal logics including, for example, hybrid logics.
	Our main result shows that the symmetries of a modal formula preserve
	entailment: if \sigma is a symmetry of \phi then \phi |= \psi if
	and only if \phi |= \sigma(\psi).},
