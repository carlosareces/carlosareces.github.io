         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We propose a logic with the dynamic modal operators copy and remove.	The copy operator replicates a given model, and the remove
            operator	removes paths in a given model. We show that the product update by	an action model in dynamic epistemic logic decomposes
            in copy and	remove operations, when we consider action models with Boolean pre-conditions	and no post-condition. We also show
            that copy and remove operators	with paths of length 1 can be expressed by action models with post-conditions.	We investigate
            the expressive power of the logic with copy and remove	operations, together with the complexity of the satisfiability problem	of
            some of its syntactic fragments.
