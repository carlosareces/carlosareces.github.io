                 for sceptical consequence in Default Logic built on
                 Hybrid Modal Logic. In turn, our tool offers support
                 for checking default consequence over formulas from
                 Propositional Logic, Basic Modal Logic and Hybrid
                 Logic. We develop a test suite for assessing the
                 correctness, scalability, and efficiency of our system,
                 and inform on the results. Interestingly, our method
                 can be adapted to generate examples for other default
                 provers.",
