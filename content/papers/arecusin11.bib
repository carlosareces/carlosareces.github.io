  abstract         = {The problem of generating referring expressions (GRE) is an important
	task in natural language generation. In this paper, we advocate for
	the use of logical languages in the output of the content determination
	phase (i.e., when the relevant features of the object to be referred
	are selected). Many difeerent logics can be used for this and we
	argue that, for a particular application, the actual choice shall
	constitute a compromise between expressive power (how many objects
	can be distinguished), computational complexity (how dificult it
	is to determine the content) and realizability (how often will the
	selected content
	be realized to an idiomatic expression). We show that well-known results
	from the area of computational logic can then be transferred to GRE.
	Moreover, our approach is orthogonal to previous proposals and we
	illustrate this by generalizing well-known content-determination
	algorithms to make them parametric on the logic employed.},
