  abstract         = {Relation-changing modal logics are extensions of the basic modal logic with dynamic operators that modify the accessibility relation of a model during the evaluation of a formula. These languages are equipped with dynamic modalities that are able, for example, to delete, add, and swap edges in the model, both locally and globally. We study the satisfiability problem for some of these logics. We first show that they can be translated into hybrid logic. As a result, we can transfer some results from hybrid logics to elation-changing modal logics. We discuss in particular, decidability for some fragments. We then show that satisfiability is, in general, undecidable for all the languages introduced, via translations from memory logics.},
