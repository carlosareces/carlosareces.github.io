                 procedure to check satisfiability of downward XPath=
                 formulas enriched with nominals and satisfaction
                 operators. The calculus is inspired by ideas introduced
                 to ensure termination of tableau calculi for certain
                 Hybrid Logics. We prove that even though we increased
                 the expressive power of XPath by introducing hybrid
                 operators, the satisfiability problem for the obtained
                 logic is still PSpace-complete.",
