         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">In this article we first show how the functional and the optimized	functional translation from modal logic to many-sorted
            first-order	logic can be naturally extended to the hybrid language H(@,\downarrow).	The translation is correct not only when
            reasoning over the class	of all models, but for any first-order definable class. We then show	that sorts can be safely removed
            (i.e., without affecting the satisfiability	status of the formula) for frame classes that can be defined in the	basic modal
            language, and show a counterexample for a frame class	defined using nominals.
