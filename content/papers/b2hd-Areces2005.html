         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">The pioneer of the use of richer logics in natural                 language semantics was Richard Montague who (most     
            famously in his paper The Proper Treatment of                 Quantification in Ordinary English [Montague, 1973])       
            showed that higher-order logic was a superb tool for                 semantic construction. The higher- order logic that 
            Montague developed for this purpose was called IL                 (Intensional Logic) and it made use of Prior&acirc;&#128;&#153;s tense 
             operators. Hence Prior and Montague have met up too. So                 why not bring all three together to Dov&acirc;&#128;&#153;s birthday
                            party? That&acirc;&#128;&#153;s what this paper is about. We are going                 to hybridize Montague&acirc;&#128;&#153;s IL in the
            simplest possible                 way (we&acirc;&#128;&#153;ll simply add nominals) to form NIL (Nominal                 Intensional Logic).
            We&acirc;&#128;&#153;ll then show that the                 resulting system is capable of assigning nominal tense                 logical
            representations, which capture the insights of                 both Reichenbach and Prior, in a compositional way.
