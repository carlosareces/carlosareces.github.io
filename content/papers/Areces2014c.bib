  abstract         = {We propose a logic with the dynamic modal operators copy and remove.
	The copy operator replicates a given model, and the remove operator
	removes paths in a given model. We show that the product update by
	an action model (with Boolean pre-conditions) in dynamic epistemic
	logic decomposes in copy and remove operations. We also show that
	copy and remove operators (of path of length 1) can be expressed
	by action models. We investigate the complexity of the satisfiability
	problem of syntactic fragments of the logic with copy and remove
	operations.},
