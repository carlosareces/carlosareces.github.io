         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We propose a logic with the dynamic modal operators                 copy and remove. The copy operator replicates a given
            model, and the remove operator removes paths in a given                 model. We show that the product update by an action
            model in dynamic epistemic logic decomposes in copy and                 remove operations, when we consider action models
            with                 Boolean pre-conditions and no post-condition. We also                 show that copy and remove operators
            with paths of                 length 1 can be expressed by action models with                 post-conditions. We investigate
            the expressive power of                 the logic with copy and remove operations, together                 with the complexity
            of the satisfiability problem of                 some of its syntactic fragments.
