         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">In recent years, an important number of theoretical                 results concerning axiomatizability, proof systems   
                         (e.g., tableaux, natural deduction), interpolation,                 expressive power, complexity, etc. for hybrid
            logics                 have been obtained. The next natural step is to develop                 provers that can handle these
            languages. HyLoRes is a                 direct resolution prover for hybrid logics implementing                 a sound and
            complete algorithm for satisfiability of                 sentences in H(@,\downarrow).
