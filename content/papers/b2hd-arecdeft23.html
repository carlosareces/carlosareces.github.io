         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We report on an implementation of a tableaux calculus                 for sceptical consequence in Default Logic built on
                            Hybrid Modal Logic. In turn, our tool offers support                 for checking default consequence over
            formulas from                 Propositional Logic, Basic Modal Logic and Hybrid                 Logic. We develop a test suite
            for assessing the                 correctness, scalability, and efficiency of our system,                 and inform on the
            results. Interestingly, our method                 can be adapted to generate examples for other default                 provers.
