  abstract         = {We show that basic hybridization (adding nominals and @ operators)
	makes it possible to give straightforward Henkin-style completeness
	proofs even when the modal logic being hybridized is higher-order.
	The key ideas are to add nominals as expressions of type t, and to
	extend to arbitrary types the way we interpret @i in propositional
	and first-order hybrid logic. This means: interpret @i \alpha_a,
	where \alpha_a is an expression of any type a, as an expression of
	type a that rigidly returns the value that \alpha_a receives at the
	i-world. The axiomatization and completeness proofs are generalizations
	of those found in propositional and first-order hybrid logic, and
	(as is usual in hybrid logic) we automatically obtain a wide range
	of completeness results for stronger logics and languages. Our approach
	is deliberately low-tech. We don't, for example, make use of Montague's
	intensional type s, or Fitting-style intensional models; we build,
	as simply as we can, hybrid logic over Henkin's logic.},
