  abstract         = {We present a coinductive definition of models for modal logics and
	show that it provides a homogeneous framework in which it is possible
	to include different modal languages ranging from classical modalities
	to operators from hybrid and memory logics. Moreover, results that
	had to be proved separately for each different language --but whose
	proofs were known to be mere routine-- now can be proved in a general
	way. We show, for example, that we can have a unique definition of
	bisimulation for all these languages, and prove a single invariance-under-bisimulation
	theorem. We then use the new framework to investigate normal forms
	for modal logics. The normal form we introduce may have a smaller
	modal depth than the original formula, and it is inspired by global
	modalities like the universal modality and the satisfiability operator
	from hybrid logics. These modalities can be extracted from under
	the scope of other operators. We provide a general definition of
	extractable modalities and show how to compute extracted normal forms.
	As it is the case with other classical normal forms --e.g., the conjunctive
	normal form of propositional logic-- the extracted normal form of
	a formula can be exponentially bigger than the original formula,
	if we require the two formulas to be equivalent. If we only require
	equi-satisfiability, then every modal formula has an extracted normal
	form which is only polynomially bigger than the original formula,
	and it can be computed in polynomial time.},
