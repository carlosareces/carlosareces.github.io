  abstract =     "Building on work by Schild, De Giacomo and Lenz-
                 erini, we establish a tight connection between
                 description logics and hybrid logics. The main aim of
                 the paper is to provide a modal perspective on some of
                 the distinguishing features of description logic. In
                 particular, by working in a hybrid logic setting we are
                 able to develop a model-theoretic understanding of both
                 asser- tional and terminological information. We also
                 show how to use the connection between description and
                 hybrid logics to transfer results on complexity and
                 expressive power from one to the other.",
