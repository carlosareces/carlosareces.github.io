                 nominals, and ALC(D), the extension of ALC with
                 concrete domains, is known to be PSpace-complete, in
                 this article we show that the combination ALCO(D) of
                 these two logics can have a NExpTime-hard concept
                 satisfiability problem (depending on the concrete
                 domain D used). The proof is by a reduction of a
                 NExpTime-complete variant of the domino problem to
                 ALCO(D)- concept satisfiability.",
