         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">GridTest is a framework for testing automated theorem                 prov- ers using randomly generated formulas. It can
            be                 used to run tests locally, in a single computer, or in                 a computer grid. It automatically
            generates a report as                 a PostScript file which, among others, includes graphs                 for time comparison.
            We have found GridTest extremely                 useful for testing and comparing the performance of                 different
            automated theorem provers (for hybrid, modal,                 first order and description logics). We present            
                GridTest in this framework description in the hope that                 it might be useful for the general community working
            in                 automated deduction.
