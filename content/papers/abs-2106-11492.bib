  abstract =     "We introduce a new semantics for a multi-agent
                 epistemic operator of knowing how, based on an
                 indistinguishability relation between plans. Our
                 proposal is, arguably, closer to the standard
                 presentation of knowing that modalities in classical
                 epistemic logic. We study the relationship between this
                 semantics and previous approaches, showing that our
                 setting is general enough to capture them. We also
                 define a sound and complete axiomatization, and
                 investigate the computational complexity of its model
                 checking and satisfiability problems.",
