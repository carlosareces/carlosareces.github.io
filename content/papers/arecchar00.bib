  abstract = {We provide two different model theoretic characterizations of a fragment
	of first-order logic which we call d-Horn formulas. This fragment
	is dual to the well known Horn fragment and has the same complexity
	for proving unsatisfiability. The method used in the characterization
	(syntactic translation functions between formulas which are mimicked
	by translation functions between models) might be applied to characterize
	other first-order restrictions. This paper is related to the work
	of Henschen and Wos \shortcite{hens:unit74}, but we study semantic
	translation together with syntactic renaming functions. We comment
	shortly on a number of applications of d-Horn formulas, one of which
	is the characterization of Context Free Grammars through a Horn $\cup$
	d-Horn first-order theory.},
