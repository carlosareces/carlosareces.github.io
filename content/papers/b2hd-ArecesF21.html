         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">In this paper we introduce sound and strongly complete                 axiomatizations for XPath with data constraints   
            extended with hybrid operators. First, we present                 HXPath= , a multi-modal version of XPath with data,    
            extended with nominals and the hybrid operator @. Then,                 we introduce an axiomatic system for HXPath= , and
            we                 prove it is strongly complete with respect to the class                 of abstract data models, i.e.,
            data models in which                 data values are abstracted as equivalence relations. We                 prove a general
            completeness result similar to the one                 presented in, e.g., [BtC06], that ensures that certain            
            extensions of the axiomatic system we introduce are                 also complete. The axiomatic systems that can be     
            obtained in this way cover a large family of hybrid                 XPath languages over different classes of frames, for
            which we present concrete examples. In addition, we                 investigate axiomatizations over the class of tree   
            models, structures widely used in practice. We show                 that a strongly complete, finitary, first-order      
                      axiomatization of hybrid XPath over trees does not                 exist, and we propose two alternatives to deal
            with                 this issue. We finally introduce filtrations to                 investigate the status of decidability
            of the                 satisfiability problem for these languages.
