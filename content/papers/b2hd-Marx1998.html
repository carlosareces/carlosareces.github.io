         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We investigate transfer of interpolation in such combinations of modal	logic which lead to interaction of the modalities.
            Combining logics	by taking products often blocks transfer of interpolation. The same	holds for combinations by taking unions,
            a generalization of Humberstone's	inaccessibility logic. Viewing first order logic as a product of	modal logics, we derive
            a strong counterexample for failure of interpolation	in the finite variable fragments of first order logic. We provide	a simple
            condition stated only in terms of frames and bisimulations	which implies failure of interpolation. Its use is exemplified
            in	a wide range of cases.
