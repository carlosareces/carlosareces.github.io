         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We present iSat, a Python command line tool to analyze and find structure	in propositional satisfiability problems. iSat offers
            an interactive	shell to control propositional solvers and generate graph representations	of the internal structure of the
            search space explored by them for	visualization, with the final aim of providing a unified environment	for propositional solving
            experimentation. iSat was designed to allow	the simple integration of both new provers and new visualizationgraphs	and statistics
            with a minimum of coding overhead.
