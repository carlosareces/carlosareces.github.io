         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We show that basic hybridization (adding nominals and                 $@$ operators) makes it possible to give           
            straightforward Henkin-style completeness proofs even                 when the modal logic being hybridized is higher-order.
            The key ideas are to add nominals as expressions of                 type t, and to extend to arbitrary types the way we  
            interpret $@_i$ in propositional and first-order hybrid                 logic. This means: interpret $@_i \alpha_a$, where
            $\alpha_a$ is an expression of any type a, as an                 expression of type a that rigidly returns the value     
            that \alpha_a receives at the $i$-world. The                 axiomatization and completeness proofs are                 generalizations
            of those found in propositional and                 first-order hybrid logic, and (as is usual in hybrid                 logic)
            we automatically obtain a wide range of                 completeness results for stronger logics and languages.          
                  Our approach is deliberately low-tech. We don't, for                 example, make use of Montague's intensional type
            s, or                 Fitting-style intensional models; we build, as simply                 as we can, hybrid logic over Henkin's
            logic.
