         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">In this article we discuss two alternative proposals                 for neighbourhood semantics (which we call strict and
            loose neighbourhood semantics, N_= and N_\subseteq                 respectively) that have been previously introduced in 
            the literature. Our main tools are suitable notions of                 bisimulation. While an elegant notion of bisimulation
                            exists for N_\subseteq, the required bisimulation for                 N_= is rather involved. We propose a
            simple extension                 of N_= with a universal modality that we call N_=(E),                 which comes together
            with a natural notion of                 bisimulation. We also investigate the complexity of the                 satisfiability
            problem for N_\subseteq and N_=(E).
