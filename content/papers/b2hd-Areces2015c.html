         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Modal logics extend classical propositional logic, and they are robustly	decidable. Whereas most existing decision procedures
            for modal logics	are based on tableau constructions, we propose a framework for obtaining	decision procedures by adding instantiation
            rules to standard SAT	and SMT solvers. Soundness, completeness, and termination of the	procedures can be proved in a uniform
            and elementary way for the	basic modal logic and some extensions.
