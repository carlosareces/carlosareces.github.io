         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We provide a detailed analysis of very weak fragments                 of modal logic. Our fragments lack connectives that
                            introduce non- determinism and they feature                 restrictions on the modal operators, which may
            lead to                 substantial reductions in complexity. Our main result                 is a general game-based characterization
            of the                 expressive power of our fragments over the class of                 finite structures.
