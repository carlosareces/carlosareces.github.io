  abstract =     "We investigate the complexity of the satisfiability
                 problem for a modal logic expressing `knowing how'
                 assertions, related to an agent's abilities to achieve
                 a certain goal. We take one of the most standard
                 semantics for this kind of logics based on linear
                 plans. Our main result is a proof that checking
                 satisfiability of a `knowing how' formula can be done
                 in $Î£_2^P$. The algorithm we present relies on
                 eliminating nested modalities in a formula, and then
                 performing multiple calls to a satisfiability checking
                 oracle for propositional logic.",
