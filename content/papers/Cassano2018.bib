  abstract =     "In this paper we introduce a prioritized default
                 logic. We build this logic modularly from Standard
                 Deontic Logic by the addition of default rules and
                 priorities among them. Our main aim is to provide a
                 logical framework to reason about scenarios where
                 prescriptive and descriptive statements coexist and may
                 be incomplete and contradictory. We motivate and
                 illustrate the technical elements of our work with the
                 use of examples (classical, and coming from software
                 engineering). In addition, we present sound, complete,
                 and terminating (with loop check) tableau-based proof
                 calculi for credulous and sceptical reasoning in our
                 logic.",
