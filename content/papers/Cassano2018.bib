  abstract         = {In this paper we introduce a prioritized default logic. We build this logic modularly from Standard Deontic Logic by the addition of default rules and priorities among them. Our main aim is to provide a logical framework to reason about scenarios where prescriptive and descriptive statements coexist and may be incomplete and contradictory. We motivate and illustrate the technical elements of our work with the use of examples (classical, and coming from software engineering). In addition, we present sound, complete, and terminating (with loop check) tableau-based proof calculi for credulous and sceptical reasoning in our logic.},
