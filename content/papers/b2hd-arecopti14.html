         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">As modeling details can have a large impact on planner performance,	domain transformation has been a traditional subject of
            interest	in the planning community not only between languages, but also within	languages. Herein, we automate an intra-language
            transformation method	that has as yet been applied only manually, and that has never been	formally described: action schema
            splitting, which transforms an	action schema with a big interface (many parameters) into several	schemas with smaller interfaces,
            exponentially reducing the number	of ground actions. We spell out this method, characterizing exactly	the choice of splits
            preserving equivalence to the original schema.	Making that choice involves a trade-off between interface size and	plan length,
            which we explore by designing automatic domain optimization	methods. Our experiments show that these methods can substantially	improve
            performance on domains with large interfaces.
