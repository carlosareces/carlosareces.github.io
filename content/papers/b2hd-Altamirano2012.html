         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We propose an algorithm for the generation of referring expressions	that adapts the approach of Areces et al. (2008, 2011)
            to include	overspecification and probabilities learned from corpora. After introducing	the algorithm, we discuss how probabilities
            required as input can	be computed for any given domain for which a suitable corpus of REs	is available, and how the probabilities
            can be adjusted for new scenes	in the domain using a machine learning approach. We exemplify how	to compute probabilities
            over the GRE3D7 corpus of Viethen (2011).	The resulting algorithm is able to generate different referring expressions	for
            the same target with a frequency similar to that observed in	corpora. We empirically evaluate the new algorithm over the GRE3D7	corpus,
            and show that the probability distribution of the generated	referring expressions match the one found in the corpus with high	accuracy.
