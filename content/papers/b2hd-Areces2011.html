         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">This paper sings a song -- a song created by bringing together the	work of four great names in the history of logic: Hans
            Reichenbach,	Arthur Prior, Richard Montague, and Leon Henkin. Although the work	of the first three of these authors have previously
            been combined,	adding the ideas of Leon Henkin is the addition required to make	the combination work at the logical level.
            But the present paper	does not focus on the underlying technicalities (these can be found	in Areces, Blackburn, Huertas, and
            Manzano [to appear]) rather it	focusses on the underlying instruments, and the way they work together.	We hope the reader
            will be tempted to sing along.
