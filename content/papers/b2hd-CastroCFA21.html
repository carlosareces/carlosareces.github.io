         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Deontic logics are dubbed the logics of normative or                 prescriptive reasoning. These logics can roughly be 
            categorized into ought-to-be, dealing with the                 prescription of state of affairs, or ought-to-do,         
            dealing with the prescription of actions. An important                 family of ought-to-do deontic logics have their origin
            in Segerberg's Deontic Action Logic (DAL, see [23]). In                 this work, we provide an algebraic characterization
            of                 DAL and some known variants. In brief, we capture                 actions and formulas as elements of dif-
            ferent base                 algebras, and deontic operators as algebraic                 operations; different algebras capture
            the different                 variants. This algebraization enables us to obtain                 complete- ness results via
            standard algebraic means.                 Moreover, we argue that this algebraic framework offers                 a natural
            way of (re-)thinking many deontic logical                 issues at large.
