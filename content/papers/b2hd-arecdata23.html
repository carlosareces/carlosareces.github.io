         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We introduce a modal language for reasoning about data                 graphs with incomplete information. Such data graphs
                            are formally represented as models in which data value                 functions are partial to capture what
            is unknown. In                 this setting, we also allow for unknown data values to                 be learned. Our main
            result is a sound and strongly                 complete axiomatization for the logic.
