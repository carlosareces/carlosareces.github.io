  abstract =     "We propose a logic with the dynamic modal operators
                 copy and remove. The copy operator replicates a given
                 model, and the remove operator removes paths in a given
                 model. We show that the product update by an action
                 model in dynamic epistemic logic decomposes in copy and
                 remove operations, when we consider action models with
                 Boolean pre-conditions and no post-condition. We also
                 show that copy and remove operators with paths of
                 length 1 can be expressed by action models with
                 post-conditions. We investigate the expressive power of
                 the logic with copy and remove operations, together
                 with the complexity of the satisfiability problem of
                 some of its syntactic fragments.",
