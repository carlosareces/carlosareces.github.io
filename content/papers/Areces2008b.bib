  abstract =     "In this paper, we propose to reinterpret the problem
                 of generating referring expressions (GRE) as the
                 problem of computing a formula in a description logic
                 that is only satisfied by the referent. This view
                 offers a new unifying perspective under which existing
                 GRE algo- rithms can be compared. We also show that by
                 applying existing algorithms for computing simulation
                 classes in description logic, we can obtain extremely
                 efficient algorithms for rela- tional referring
                 expressions without any dan- ger of running into
                 infinite regress.",
