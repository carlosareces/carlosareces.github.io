                 modal logics where we can explicitly refer to the
                 elements in the model. In this paper we will start by
                 introducing hybrid logics from that perspective, and we
                 will complete this presentation with a historical
                 overview. But we will later have a closer look to the
                 â†“ binder, and propose an alternative way to think
                 about it. We will explain then how, in this new light,
                 a whole new spectrum of logical languages is offered to
                 the enterprising logician.",
