         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We provide a detailed analysis of very weak fragments                 of modal logics. Our fragments lack connectives that
                            introduce non-determinism and they feature restrictions                 on the modal operators, which may
            lead to substantial                 reductions in complexity. Our main result is a general                 game-based characterization
            of the expressive power of                 our fragments over the class of finite structures.
