         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We consider dynamic modal operators that can change the relation of	a model during the evaluation of a formula. In particular,
            we extend	the basic modal language with modalities that are able to delete,	add or swap pairs of related elements of the domain.
            In this paper,	we explore tableau calculi as satisfiability and model building procedures	for these logics.
