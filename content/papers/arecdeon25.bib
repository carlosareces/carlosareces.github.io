  abstract = "In a seminal work, K. Segerberg introduced deontic action logic (DAL) as a formal
framework to investigate normative reasoning over actions. In this work, we re-
visit DAL and provide a complete algebraization for it. To this end, we introduce
deontic action algebras—algebraic structures consisting of a Boolean algebra for
interpreting actions, a Boolean algebra for interpreting formulas, and two map-
pings from one Boolean algebra to the other interpreting the deontic concepts of
permission and prohibition. We show how this framework supports the derivation
of various deontic action logics by imposing or relaxing structural conditions on
either Boolean algebra. This flexibility allows us to uniformly account for several
logics within the broader DAL family. In particular, we introduce four variations
obtained by: (a) enriching the algebra of formulas with propositions on states, (b)
adopting a Heyting algebra for state propositions, (c) adopting a Heyting algebra
for actions, and (d) adopting Heyting algebras for both. We illustrate these new
deontic action logics with examples and establish their algebraic completeness.",
