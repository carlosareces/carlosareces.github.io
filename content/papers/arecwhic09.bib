  abstract = {In this article we discuss two alternative proposals for neighbourhood
	semantics (which we call strict and loose neighbourhood semantics,
	N_= and N_\subseteq respectively) that have been previously introduced
	in the literature. Our main tools are suitable notions of bisimulation.
	While an elegant notion of bisimulation exists for N_\subseteq, the
	required bisimulation for N_= is rather involved. We propose a simple
	extension of N_= with a universal modality that we call N_=(E), which
	comes together with a natural notion of bisimulation. We also investigate
	the complexity of the satisfiability problem for N_\subseteq and
	N_=(E).},
