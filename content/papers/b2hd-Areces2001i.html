         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We provide a resolution-based proof procedure for                 modal, description and hybrid logic that improves on   
            previous proposals in important ways. It avoids                 translations into large unde- cidable logics, and works  
            directly on modal, description or hybrid logic formulas                 instead. In addition, by using the hybrid machinery
            it                 avoids the complexities of earlier propositional                 resolution-based methods for modal logic.
            It combines                 ideas from the method of prefixes used in tableaux, and                 resolution ideas in such
            a way that some of the                 heuristics and optimizations devised in either field                 are applicable.
