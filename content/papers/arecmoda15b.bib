  abstract         = {We propose a logic with the dynamic modal operators copy and remove.
	The copy operator replicates a given model, and the remove operator
	removes paths in a given model. We show that the product update by
	an action model in dynamic epistemic logic decomposes in copy and
	remove operations, when we consider action models with Boolean pre-conditions
	and no post-condition. We also show that copy and remove operators
	with paths of length 1 can be expressed by action models with post-conditions.
	We investigate the expressive power of the logic with copy and remove
	operations, together with the complexity of the satisfiability problem
	of some of its syntactic fragments.},
