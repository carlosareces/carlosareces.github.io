  abstract         = {We investigate dynamic modal operators that can change the model during
	evaluation. We define the logic SL by extending the basic modal language
	with the $\swap$ modality, which is a diamond operator that in addition
	has the ability to invert pairs of related elements in the domain
	while traversing an edge of the accessibility relation. SL is very
	expressive: it fails to have the finite and the tree model property.
	We show that SL is equivalent to a fragment of first-order logic
	by providing a satisfiability preserving translation. In addition,
	we provide an equivalence preserving translation from SL to the hybrid
	logic H(:, $\downarrow$). We also define a suitable notion of bisimulation
	for SL and investigate its expressive power, showing that it lies
	strictly between the basic modal logic and H(:, $\downarrow$). We
	finally show that its model checking problem is PSpace-complete and
	its satisfiability problem is undecidable.},
