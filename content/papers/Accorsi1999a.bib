  abstract =     "In this paper we report on ongoing work on using a
                 constraint-based approach towards feature interaction.
                 From a logic specification of the Basic Call Service
                 (BCS), we derive a labelled transition system
                 representing this service. This graphical
                 interpretation is implemented in smodels and tested for
                 a variety of properties. We have devised a stepwise
                 methodology for integrating features. According to our
                 method, features act as constraints on models of the
                 original basic system. On the one hand they forbid some
                 of the original behaviour of the system (thus pruning
                 some models), and on the other they give rise to new
                 models, representing new behaviour. Using this
                 methodology, we have implemented a small number of
                 features on top of the basic call service, and we
                 report on some of the tests that we have performed.",
