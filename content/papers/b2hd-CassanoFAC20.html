         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Default Logic refers to a family of formalisms                 designed to carry out non-monotonic reasoning over a      
            monotonic logic (in general, Classical First-Order or                 Propositional Logic). Traditionally, default logics
            have been dened and dealt with via syntactic                 consequence relations. Here, we introduce a family of       
                     default logics dened over modal logics. First, we                 present these default logics syntactically. Then,
            we                 elaborate on an algebraic counterpart. We do the latter                 by extending the notion of a modal
            algebra to                 acommodate for the main elements of default logics:                 defaults and extensions. Our
            algebraic treatment of                 default logics concludes with an algebraic completeness                 result. To
            our knowledge, our approach is novel, and it                 lays the groundwork for studying default logics from a      
                      dynamic logic perspective.
