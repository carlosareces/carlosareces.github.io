         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Default Logic refers to a family of formalisms designed to carry out non-monotonic reasoning over a monotonic logic (in general,
            Classical First-Order or Propositional Logic). Traditionally, default logics have been dened and dealt with via syntactic
            consequence relations. Here, we introduce a family of default logics dened over modal logics. First, we present these default
            logics syntactically. Then, we elaborate on an algebraic counterpart. We do the latter by extending the notion of a modal
            algebra to acommodate for the main elements of default logics: defaults and extensions. Our algebraic treatment of default
            logics concludes with an algebraic completeness result. To our knowledge, our approach is novel, and it lays the groundwork
            for studying default logics from a dynamic logic perspective.
