         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">The problem of generating referring expressions (GRE) is an important	task in natural language generation. In this paper,
            we advocate for	the use of logical languages in the output of the content determination	phase (i.e., when the relevant features
            of the object to be referred	are selected). Many difeerent logics can be used for this and we	argue that, for a particular
            application, the actual choice shall	constitute a compromise between expressive power (how many objects	can be distinguished),
            computational complexity (how dificult it	is to determine the content) and realizability (how often will the	selected content	be
            realized to an idiomatic expression). We show that well-known results	from the area of computational logic can then be transferred
            to GRE.	Moreover, our approach is orthogonal to previous proposals and we	illustrate this by generalizing well-known content-determination	algorithms
            to make them parametric on the logic employed.
