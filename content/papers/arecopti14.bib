  abstract = {As modeling details can have a large impact on planner performance,
	domain transformation has been a traditional subject of interest
	in the planning community not only between languages, but also within
	languages. Herein, we automate an intra-language transformation method
	that has as yet been applied only manually, and that has never been
	formally described: action schema splitting, which transforms an
	action schema with a big interface (many parameters) into several
	schemas with smaller interfaces, exponentially reducing the number
	of ground actions. We spell out this method, characterizing exactly
	the choice of splits preserving equivalence to the original schema.
	Making that choice involves a trade-off between interface size and
	plan length, which we explore by designing automatic domain optimization
	methods. Our experiments show that these methods can substantially
	improve performance on domains with large interfaces.},
