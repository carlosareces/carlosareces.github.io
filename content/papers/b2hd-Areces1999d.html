         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">We present a formal model for the specification of                 telephone features by means of description logics. Our
            framework permits the formal definition of the basic                 telephone system as well as the specification of    
                        additional features. By using standard techniques from                 description logic reasoning, properties
            of features can                 be proved and interactions detected. An ExpTime upper                 bound for the complexity
            of detecting feature                 interaction as a satisfiability problem is obtained by                 well known results
            for expressive description                 languages.
