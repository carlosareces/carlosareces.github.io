  abstract =     "We introduce a novel semantics for a multi-agent
                 epistemic operator of knowing how, based on an
                 indistinguishability relation between plans. Our
                 proposal is, arguably, closer to the standard
                 presentation of knowing that modalities in classical
                 epistemic logic. We study the relationship between this
                 new semantics and previous approaches, showing that our
                 setting is general enough to capture them. We also
                 study the logical properties of the new semantics.
                 First, we define a sound and complete axiomatization.
                 Second, we define a suitable notion of bisimulation and
                 prove correspondence theorems. Finally, we investigate
                 the computational complexity of the model checking and
                 satisfiability problems for the new logic.",
