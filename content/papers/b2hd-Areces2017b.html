         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">Let F = (F, R) be a finite Kripke frame. A congruence                 of F is a bisimulation of F that is also an equivalence
            relation on F. The set of all congruences of F is a                 lattice under the inclusion ordering. In this article
            we investigate this lattice in the case that F is a                 finite line frame. We give concrete descriptions of the
                            join and meet of two congruences with a nontrivial                 upper bound. Through these descriptions
            we show that                 for every nontrivial congruence rho, the interval                 [Id_F, rho] embeds into the
            lattice of divisors of a                 suitable positive integer. We also prove that any two                 congruences
            with a nontrivial upper bound permute.
