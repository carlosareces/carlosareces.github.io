         <h3>Abstract</h3>
         <p class="abstract">In this article we first show how the functional and                 the optimized functional translation from modal logic
            to many-sorted first-order logic can be naturally                 extended to the hybrid language H(@,\downarrow). The   
                         translation is correct not only when reasoning over the                 class of all models, but for any first-order
            definable                 class. We then show that sorts can be safely removed                 (i.e., without affecting the
            satisfiability status of                 the formula) for frame classes that can be defined in                 the basic modal
            language, and show a counterexample for                 a frame class defined using nominals.
