  abstract =     "GridTest is a framework for testing automated theorem
                 prov- ers using randomly generated formulas. It can be
                 used to run tests locally, in a single computer, or in
                 a computer grid. It automatically generates a report as
                 a PostScript file which, among others, includes graphs
                 for time comparison. We have found GridTest extremely
                 useful for testing and comparing the performance of
                 different automated theorem provers (for hybrid, modal,
                 first order and description logics). We present
                 GridTest in this framework description in the hope that
                 it might be useful for the general community working in
                 automated deduction.",
