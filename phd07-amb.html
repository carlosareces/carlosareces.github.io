Description of the Subject:</A>

<P>
The crucial role that inference play in many NLP applications is
currently widely acknowledged. Classical examples are the verification
of the relevance and consistency of a contributed sentence to a given
dialog (which can be verified in terms of entailment and
satisfiability, respectively) [Blackburn and Bos, Blackburn et al,
1998]. Automatic tools able to cope with these two tasks (entailment
and satisfiability) are, nowadays, well developed both for classical
logics (e.g., first-order logic) and for languages specifically
designed for knowledge representation (e.g., description logics).

<P>
The model building task which requires, given a set of formulas, to
actually <SPAN  CLASS="textit">produce</SPAN> a model that satisfies them, is on the other hand
much less well understood, specially when certain structural properties
(e.g., minimality in the size of the domain) are required from the
model.  Model building under structural constrains is, perhaps, even
more fundamental for NLP applications than entailment and
satisfiability.  For example, basic NLP tasks like resolving referring
expressions in a dialog rely on the constructions of adequate models
for the discourse so far.

<P>
Both theoretically and technically, the difference currently existing
between the satisfiability inference task (SAT) and the model building
inference task (MB) is enormous.  While highly optimized SAT provers
exists for logical languages ranging from the very weak propositional
language, to modal-like languages, to first-order languages; there
only very few tools for MB.  The only two systems that deserves
mentioning are PARADOX (http://www.cs.chalmers.se/&nbsp;koen/folkung/) and Mace
(http://www.cs.unm.edu/&nbsp;mccune/prover9/).  Recently, though, the model 
building task is gaining relevance.

<P>
In this thesis we will develop and implement algorithms for model
building under structural constrains; and investigate optimizations
and heuristics.  The main emphasis will be on model building for
knowledge representation languages (e.g., modal, description and
temporal logics), using structural constraints typical from NLP tasks.
