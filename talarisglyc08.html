The
main aim of the InToHyLo&nbsp;project  (Inference Tools for Hybrid Logics) is
to investigate inference methods for hybrid logics, to develop highly
optimized inference tools based on these methods, and to use these
tools in natural language applications with a special focus on
Dialogue Systems and Textual Entailment.&nbsp;Talaris and GLyC
have been working in collaboration in this area since 2003. As a
result of this collaboration they are seen nowadays as
leaders in the area of computational hybrid logic and automated
inference for hybrid logics, and they are the developers of two
advanced automated theorem provers &#8211; HyLoRes, based on resolution,
and HTab, based on tableaux &#8211; and of a variety of related tools (e.g.,
a graphical interface to the reasoners called HyLoRun, the model
checker for hybrid logic Mcheck, the random formula generator Hgen,
an automated testing environment, etc.). 
</p>
<p align="left">In
the framework of the InToHyLo (Inference Tools for Hybrid Logics,
<a href="http://hylo.loria.fr/intohylo">http://hylo.loria.fr/intohylo</a>)
project that we will carry out during the next three years, we plan
to integrate the tools that we have already developed in a common
platform, investigate their complexity and develop and implement
optimized algorithms for new reasoning tasks (e.g., model generation,
model checking, bisimulation checking, retrieval). We also want to
investigate how to combine resolution and tableaux algorithms to
allow our provers to collaborate (share partial results) while
working on a given problem. Finally, we want to develop parallel
inference algorithms to improve performance, and distributed testing
to speed up developing. 
</p>
<p>Talaris and GLyC have been collaborating in theoretical research and
in the development of inference algorithms and tools for hybrid
logics, with particular interest in providing inference services for
natural language processing (NLP) applications. During 2007, the
tools developed by the teams have reached an advanced level of
maturity, both in terms of their theoretical underpinnings and with
respect to implementation (they are currently the best inference
tools for hybrid logic available worldwide). The moment is ready for
tackling their development into an integrated inference system that
can be used in complex NLP applications. We are starting to integrate
these tools in the InToHyLo
platform (<a href="http://hylo.loria.fr/intohylo">http://hylo.loria.fr/intohylo</a>)
to offer a varied spectrum of inference services for different hybrid
logics. </p>
<p><b>Scientific
Task envisioned for the next three years:</b> Besides
continuing their ongoing research on inference in hybrid logics,
during the next three years the collaboration between the Talaris and GLyC aims to work in a number of concrete improvements
and important research questions (full details are provided in
Section II. Programme de Travail): </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Currently our tools treat "one
problem at a time": if the same inference task is repeatedly submitted
to the reasoner, it will be each time solved from scratch. We will
integrate the different tools we have developed into a server/client
architecture. The inference algorithm hosted in the server will be able
to reuse information from previous calls from the client;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop optimizations that take
advantage of this new architecture. In particular, different reasoning
algorithms can collaborate and share results in a way that is
transparent to the client; </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design, implement and test
parallel versions of the inference algorithms to improve performance;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigate ways to enhance the
range of inference services provided (e.g., model building, retrieval);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify the algorithms to ensure
correctness and test them for efficiency;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Finally, we want to extend our
results, algorithms and tools to alternative semantics (e.g.,
topological and neighbourhood semantics) and to more expressive logics
(e.g., first order hybrid logics). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p align="left">As
mentioned above, we have already developed highly optimized provers
for different hybrid logics (i.e., HyLoRes and HTab). We are
currently adapting these provers to take advantage of the presence of
multiple cores in a CPU. We have also adapted our testing environment
to work on a grid (we are currently using Grid5000,
<a href="http://www.grid5000.fr/">http://www.grid5000.fr</a>).
We are
currently well situated to carry out the integration of the different
inference tools within a common platform and develop ways in which
they can interact and share results. This will be the main goal
during the first year of the project. Once the tools are integrated
we will be able to test them in different NLP applications. Our main
focus will be on Dialogue Systems. The main goal of the second year
will be to extend the inference services provided by our tools to
better match the needs of the NLP applications. In particular we will
develop model building algorithms working under constraints imposed
by the application, and model maintenance systems. During these phase
we might need to adapt our tools to alternative semantics (e.g.,
topological or neighbourhood semantics) or to different hybrid
languages (e.g., first-order hybrid logics, memory logics, etc.) in
case the standard relational semantics or the expressive power are
not suitable for the NLP task. These will be the topic of the last
year of the InToHyLo project.

<b>Presentation
of the two teams applying for the Equipe Associée:</b>
Talaris is a specialist in the area of representation and inference
in natural language processing, and some of their members (e.g., P.
Blackburn, C. Areces and G. Hoffmann) actively work on theoretical
and computational aspects of hybrid logics. GLyC on the other hand,
specializes on computability and complexity especially for modal and
hybrid logics and recently, with the addition of J. Castaño to
the full research staff, is also involved in information management
and information extraction. Clearly the two teams share many common
interests, and at the same time complement each other in interesting
ways. The following list mentions subjects relevant to InToHyLo and
the members of the Talaris which are working on them: Semantics
and Pragmatics of Dialogue Systems (L. Benotti, P. Blackburn, A.
Denis, and M. Quignard), Textual Entailment (P. Bedaride and C.
Gardent), Generation of Referring Expressions (C. Areces and G.
Hoffmann), Inference Services for NLP (C. Areces, P. Bedaride, L.
Benotti, P. Blackburn and G. Hoffmann), Hybrid and Memory Logics (C.
Areces, P. Blackburn, and G. Hoffmann). GLyC members are world
specialists on inference algorithms, complexity and computability for
hybrid logics and, on the other hand, actively working on
computational linguistics and information extraction (in particular,
treating problems that require some
context
sensitive information, parsing, lexical information, temporal
reasoning and modelling, event change, and extraction of complex
relations from scientific texts.) The following list mentions
subjects relevant to InToHyLo and the members of GLyC which are
working on them: Expressive Power of Hybrid and Memory Logics (S.
Figueira, S. Mera), Inference Methods (D. Gorín and D. Koile),
Parallel and Distributed Proving and Testing (D. Gorín, M. Pérez
Rodríguez and D. Rubinstein), Information Maintenance and
Information Extraction (C. Bruzzoni and J. Castaño), Computability
and Complexity (V. Becher and R. Rodríguez).

<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="left"><b>Short
history of collaboration between the two groups:</b>
C.
Areces is a graduate from the Departamento de Computación of the
Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA). GLyC was born in part from his
continuous collaboration with the UBA during his postdoctoral
studies. Dr. Areces, Dr. Blackburn and Dr. Becher are currently
co-directing (as a co-tutelle between the Universidad de Buenos Aires
and the Université Henri Poincare) the doctoral studies of D. Gorín
and S. Mera, two research members of GLyC. Moreover, C. Areces has
supervised the master thesis of four master students, members of
GLyC. <em><br>&nbsp; &nbsp; Previous exchanges between the two teams:</em>
S.
Figueira visited Talaris during 2007 for three months with funds
provided by Erasmus Mundus (he collaborated with C. Areces and P.
Blackburn in the preparation of the course Introduction to
Computability for the Erasmus Mundus Masters in Language and
Communication Technologies). V. Becher has visited Talaris twice for
short periods (to discuss general collaboration plans between the two
teams) with GLyC funds. D. Gorín and S. Mera have visited Talaris in
four occasions (twice using INRIA internship funding, once
with GLyC funds, and once using funds from the Programme de Coopération
MINCyT - INRIA/CNRS, the duration of the visits are between 1 and 3
months). M. Perez Rodríguez is visiting Talaris for three months for
an internship funded by INRIA and the PARLO Project
(<a href="http://talc.loria.fr/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=operations:parlo">http://talc.loria.fr/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=operations:parlo</a>)
within the TALC framework (TALC, Traitement Automatique des Langues et
des Connaissances, is one of the five themes represented in the CPER
MINS, Contrat Plan Etat Region Modélisation, Information et Systèmes
Numériques, involving INRIA Nancy Grand Est, <a href="http://talc.loria.fr/">http://talc.loria.fr/</a>).<br>
C.
Areces visits GLyC yearly (own funds, and GLyC and UBA funds). He has
taught three Master courses ("Computational Modal Logics,"
"Description Logics" and "Advanced Modal Logics")
during these visits and many invited seminars. P. Blackburn has
visited GLyC once to teach a masters course ("Introduction to
Hybrid Logics") together with C. Areces in 2008 (visit funded by
the Microbio project and by Talaris). C. Gardent has visited GLyC
once to teach a seminar on "Inference in NLP" (visit funded
by Talaris and GLyC). L. Benotti has visited GLyC once for a week
(own and GLyC funds).<br>
<span></span> &nbsp; &nbsp;The
two groups have developed in collaboration two automated theorem
provers for hybrid logics (HyLoRes, based on the resolution method,
and HTab, based on the tableaux method) and a number of other related
tools (a random formula generator for testing, a testing environment,
a model checker, a library of optimized functions, etc.). Information
about these tools can be found in the InToHyLo portal
(<a href="http://hylo.loria.fr/intohylo">http://hylo.loria.fr/intohylo</a>).<br><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; Joint

<b>Impact
of the collaboration on the scientific objectives of the involved
teams:</b>
During
previous years, the
collaboration between Talaris and GLyC was done mainly via internet.
As the collaboration did not have any particular funds assigned, it
was difficult to formulate a plan for the long terms activities of
the two teams. The only regular personal exchange were the yearly
visits of C. Areces (usually with own funds and during vacation time
taken in Argentina). All other visits were organized taking advantage
of funds obtained from very different sources (INRIA
Internships, Erasmus Mundus Master Program, Escuela de Ciencias
Informaticas de la Universidad de Buenos Aires, Programme de
Coopération MINCyT - INRIA/CNRS, CPER MISN Axe TALC, etc).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;Even under these
conditions, the research collaboration has advanced extraordinarily
and we are currently leading the area of inference for hybrid logics.
But the time is now ripe to organize a long term work agenda. Such
agenda contains both important theoretical questions to tackle and
serious development and implementation of the inference tools created
by the two teams. Most importantly, the fundamental tools are now
ready for their application to different Natural Language Processing
task, but carrying out these items involves important new challenges
that can only be met by pulling together very tightly the areas of
expertise of both teams. Such an agenda can only be met if sufficient
funds for regular collaboration, the hosting of meetings and exchange of ideas can be ensured for at least the next three
years. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;With the recent incorporation of J. Castaño to GLyC, the
moment seems to be particularly propitious for the task, as his
experience greatly reinforces the
interest and skills of GLyC in NLP. <br>
As we have discussed in the
previous pages, the topics addressed by the collaboration touch on
the main interest of many full time researchers and PhD students in both
groups. In particular, it will pull together the research
contributions of five different PhD students. We believe that the
impact of the collaboration will be enormous for both groups.
<br>
</p>
<p align="left"><em><b>Impact
of the collaboration on the relation between the teams and between
the institutes involved:</b></em>
The
collaboration between GLyC and Talaris has by now a long story (to
witness this it is enough to review the list of <em>more
than fifteen</em> joint
publications). Till now, this collaboration has been carried out
without any particular funding framework that would help defining
long terms plans, and a more effective research strategy. We believe
that, starting from the results obtained up to now, the two teams are
ready to make a real contribution to the field of automated inference
in general, and to the automated inferences required in different
natural processing task, in particular.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;The inference tools of the
InToHyLo platform are open source and&nbsp;can be freely used and further developed by
anyone interested. Their use is not restricted to natural language
applications: even though we are specially interested in developing
inferences services for NLP, fundamental inference services like
satisfiability testing, model checking, model building, etc. have
very general applications. With respect to the developed tools then,
InToHyLo will have impact in many other INRIA projects, and in
particular in other INRIA projects interested in inference in NLP
(e.g., <a href="http://www.loria.fr/equipes/calligramme/">Calligramme</a>,
<a href="http://www.loria.fr/equipes/orpailleur/">Orpailleur</a>,
<a href="http://signes.labri.fr/">Signes</a>, etc).
Our theoretical
results and inference methods are relevant to other CNRS and INRIA
teams working in computational logic (<a href="http://pareo.loria.fr/">PAREO</a>,
<a href="http://equipes-lig.imag.fr/capp/">CAPP</a>,
<a href="http://www.irit.fr/ACTIVITES/LILaC/">LILaC</a>,&nbsp;etc).<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;In addition to the points mentioned above, which are
directly related to the main goals of InToHyLo, we are planning to
take this opportunity to encourage
the development of the area of Natural Language Processing in
Argentina, which is currently seriously lacking. Finally, during the
collaboration with GLyC, Talaris is interested in starting new joint
work with other groups in Argentina. In particular, we
are interested in developing collaboration with the <a href="http://www.dependex.dc.uba.ar/">Tools
and Foundations for Software Engineering Lab</a> at the
Universidad
de Buenos Aires; and with the <a href="http://www.cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/%7Epln/">Grupo

A) I
am not aware of ongoing projects between the Departamento de
Computación de la Universidad de Buenos Aires (UBA) and INRIA. This
Department is, arguably, the most important Theoretical Computer
Science research centre in Argentina. I know that a number of INRIA
researchers (including myself) have taught courses at the ECI
(Escuela de Ciencias Informáticas,
<a href="http://www.dc.uba.ar/events/eci/">http://www.dc.uba.ar/events/eci/</a>).
Also, a number of students from the Departmento de Computación de la
Universidad de Buenos Aires (including 4 members of GLyC) have
visited INRIA Nancy Grand Est using the <a href="http://www-direction.inria.fr/international/PROGRAMMES/internship/index.html">INRIA
Internship Program</a>. Other senior researchers from UBA visit
LORIA
sporadically. Summing up, a de facto program of exchange and
collaboration is already in effect, but it has not yet been provided
a suitable framework for long term strategic planning of research
activities. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;INRIA has provided signs of interest in collaboration
with Argentina and most generally with Latin America in the form of
the STIC-Argentine (now called MINCyT, for collaboration between
INRIA/CNRS and Argentina ) and the <a href="http://www.sticamsud.org/">STIC-AmSud</a>
program (for the collaboration between Francia, Argentina, Brasil,
Chile, Perú and Uruguay links INRIA with the Ministerio de Ciencia,
Tecnología e Innovación Productiva <a href="http://www.secyt.gov.ar/">(</a><a href="http://www.secyt.gov.ar/">http://www.mincyt.gov.ar</a><a href="http://www.secyt.gov.ar/">)</a>
MinCyT, de Argentina). C. Areces takes part of the <a href="http://www.microbioamsud.net/">Project
Microbio</a> which was accepted by STIC-AmSud and started in
January
2008. This project links Talaris with the <a href="http://www.cs.famaf.unc.edu.ar/%7Epln/">Grupo
de Procesamiento de Lenguaje Natural</a> de la Universidad
Nacional
de Córdoba. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp;The only project "Equipes Associées" with
a partner in Argentina that I have found is the project FIM
(<a href="http://www.irisa.fr/vista/ftp/fim/dossier_fim_2006.html">http://www.irisa.fr/vista/ftp/fim/dossier_fim_2006.html</a>)
with the Facultad de Ingeniería (Engineering Faculty) of the
Universidad de Buenos Aires.</p>
<p>B)
The major part of the budget of 2009 is devoted to exchanges
between GLyC and Talaris. Notice though that many members of Talaris
organize seminars (both at the Master and PhD level) during their
visits to GLyC. In addition, during the visit of senior or PhD
members from GLyC, research talks are organized in the framework of
Talaris regular meetings, or in different ongoing scientific events.
If additional funds are secured then some of the funds provided by
the Equipe Associée could be used to organize a national meeting in
Buenos Aires (as we mentioned above we are interested in developing
contacts with the Universidad Nacional de Córdoba and the
Universidad Nacional de Rosario). In any case, Talaris will be
hosting the Hybrid Logic Workshop during 2009 (the main conference on
hybrid logics) and the participation of GLyC researches in this event
is, of course, highly relevant. During 2010 we are planning to
organize only two rounds of exchanges and use part of the funds to
organize a workshop on Inference for NLP hosted by Talaris.

<p align="center">Description du

<p>Talaris and GLyC have been collaborating since 2003 in theoretical
research and in the development of inference algorithms and tools for
hybrid logics, with particular interest in providing inference
services for natural language processing (NLP) applications. During
2007, the tools developed by the teams have reached an advanced level
of maturity, both in terms of their theoretical underpinnings and
with respect to implementation (they are currently the best inference
tools for hybrid logic available worldwide, and outperform, in
certain tasks, tools like FaCT++ one of the most advanced theorem
provers in the area of description logics). The moment is ready for
tackling their development into an integrated inference system that
can be used in complex NLP applications. We are starting to integrate
these tools in the InToHyLo
platform (<a href="http://hylo.loria.fr/intohylo">http://hylo.loria.fr/intohylo</a>)
to offer a varied spectrum of inference services for different hybrid
logics. Besides continuing our ongoing research on inference in
hybrid logics, during the next three years we aim to work in a number
of concrete improvements and important research questions: </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Currently our tools treat "one
problem at a time." In particular, if the same inference task is
repeatedly submitted to the reasoner, it will be each time solved from
scratch. Up to now, our tools have no notion of "information state" and
cannot reused previous results. We want to integrate the different
tools we have developed into a server/client architecture, and move
from a "case by case" reasoning model into a "information state based"
reasoning model".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop optimizations that take
advantage of this new architecture. In particular, different reasoning
algorithms can collaborate and share results in a way that is
transparent to the client.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Design, implement and test
parallel versions of the inference algorithms to improve performance.
Some of the algorithms we use could benefit from the existence of
shared memory and multiple cores in a CPU. We have already a prototype
version of HyLoRes that perform resolution via parallel thread that
share a common pool of solved clauses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Investigate ways to enhance the
range of inference services provided (e.g., model building, retrieval).
Both HyLoRes and HTab can now do model building when the input formula
is satisfiable. But this algorithms are not yet properly optimized, and
they cannot guarantee any additional property over the generated model
(e.g., minimal size). We are currently exploring algorithms for
retrieval. We also have prototypes for both model checkers and
bisimulation checkers for different hybrid logics.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Verify the algorithms to ensure
correctness and test them for efficiency. Because we have developed
different tools that can solve the same inference problem in different
ways, we can test their correctness via redundancy: if we obtain the
same answer from the different reasoning tools, our confidence on the
correctness of the algorithms increases. But testing is time consuming.
We have adapted our automated testing environment to make use of the
facilities of the Grid5000 networks. This work is still very
preliminary, but once completed we will be able to do distributed
testing obtaining an enormous speed up of the testing process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, we want to extend our
results, algorithms and tools to alternative semantics (e.g.,
topological and neighbourhood semantics) and to more expressive logics
(e.g., first order hybrid logics). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>With
the <em>InToHyLo</em>
project,&nbsp;Talaris and GLyC aim to continue their investigation and
implementation of inference algorithms for hybrid logics. During the
last years, the groups have developed two independent automated
provers HyLoRes (based on resolution) and HTab (based on tableaux),
together with a graphical interface to both of them that is called
HyLoRun. HyLoRes is the most mature system of the two, and includes
many state-of-the-art optimizations. Starting from the resources and
the experience obtained during the development of HyLoRes, we were
able to develop the first version of HTab through 2007 and we are
currently including optimizations. The next step is to take advantage
of the inherent dual behaviour existing between the resolution based
and the tableaux based calculi: while the resolution method performs
better on unsatisfiable formulas (during resolution we only need to
derive the empty clause to detect that a formula is unsatisfiable),
the tableau method performs better on satisfiable formulas (while
constructing a tableau we only need to find a saturated open branch
to detect that a formula is satisfiable). We have already tested this
intuition empirically: there are satisfiable formulas for which the
current version of HTab (even when only minimal optimizations are
activated) performs better than HyLoRes. </p>
<p>Our
first step will be to transform HyLoRes and HTab into server
applications, while HyLoRun will act as a client application which
will connect to the provers submitting queries and displaying the
results. HyLoRun will detect whether HyLoRes and/or HTab are running
as servers and connect to them using either HTTP or TCP services.
This architecture is the one used by the description logic provers
like RACER and it has some important benefits: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>To
start with, the different components of InToHyLo (initially, the two
provers and the front-end) can evolve independently without interfering
with applications making use of them, as long as the communication
protocols are maintained. In addition, new inference tools can be added
as additional servers and only the front-end will need to be modified
to offer these additional services. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Secondly,
we want to investigate ways in which the two provers can collaborate
while working in a given problem. With this idea in mind, we want the
provers to be able to exchange information (i.e., partial results) in a
manner that is transparent to the user. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>But
the most important reason for choosing this architecture is that it
lets us implement a notion of "information state". This idea is again a
fundamental characteristic of DL provers like RACER: the user should be
able to load a problem into the system, and then query it for answers.
Many different queries are usually posed to the prover about the same
problem, and the prover can take advantage of previous results to
answer future queries. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>After
this first step, the reasoner's architecture will be in place to
tackle the other goals mentioned above. The items that we are
planning to approach during 2009 are: development of parallel
algorithms, distributed testing using the Grid5000 first, and then
the Grid being installed by TALC, and the investigation of additional
inference services (mainly model building for hybrid logics).</p>
<p>By
the end of 2009 we are planning to start using InToHyLo in NLP
applications currently being investigated by Talaris (mainly,
dialogue systems and text entailment). Tuning the inference system
for these applications will be the main research topic for 2010.</p>
<p>Summing
up, a direct result of the Equipe Associée project will be a
strengthening of the ongoing, and up to now very successful, research
collaboration between Talaris and GLyC. Moreover, a concrete
aim during the coming years is to develop the InToHyLo platform and
put it to use in different NLP projects being carried out by GLyC and
Talaris. Finally, as a by product, we expect to encourage the
development of the area of Natural Language Processing in Argentina,
which is currently seriously lacking.</p>

<p align="left">Both
Talaris and GLyC have independent funding of their own obtained from
their hosting institutions and other projects (see the respective
webpages), but funds specifically set aside for their collaboration are
very small. <br>
C. Areces has obtained funds from STIC-AmSud for the project Microbio (<a href="http://www.microbioamsud.net/">http://www.microbioamsud.net/</a>)
to be done in collaboration with the Universidad Nacional de Cordoba in
Argentina. By coordinating missions with this project, Microbio can
provide funds to cover some of the expenses of visits of Talaris
members to GLyC during 2008/2009. In particular, the visit of L.
Benotti to GLyC, planned for December 2008 is funded by coordinating
the trip with a meeting of the Microbio project in Cordoba during the
same period. <br>
C. Areces has obtained funds for exchange of researchers in the
framework of the Programme de Coopération MINCyT - INRIA/CNRS (funds
provided by INRIA, CNRS
and MinCyT). By coordinating missions with this project some travel
expenses can be covered. In particular, the visit of C. Areces to GLyC,
planned for December 2008 is partially funded by MINCyT-INRIA/CNRS.<br>
Talaris has submitted a topic for the ongoing call for INRIA
Internships. <br>
Research funds in Argentina are very limited. GLyC has obtained
sporadic funds to cover travel expenses. In general, we <b>cannot</b>
expect
symmetric funding to match those provided by INRIA.
